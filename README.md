# Consumer-Reviews-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
This project was done within an Externship for Beats By Dre. 

The process leading up to the final project includes: 

Data Gathering: 
1000+ Amazon reviews were scraped using OxyLabs and then merged to create a cumulative dataset. 

Data Cleaning:
Reviews were cleaned to address standardization, null values, cleaning of column values, etc..

Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization:
Python libraries were used to find statistical values, trends, and insights within the data. Trends and distributions were then visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Sentiment Analysis:
Textblob and NLTK implemented to extract sentiment values for reviews and provide distribution data and key phrases. 

Gemini AI Api:
Using a personal API for Gemini AI, a chatbot was created and certain prompts were pushed to extract more product insights. 

Capstone Project:
A final project was consolidated using previous code and other visualizations and insights gained specifically for the Beats Pill.
