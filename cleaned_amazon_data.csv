R3ED0R4VCG7DP7,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Speaker for All Needs,Colin,5,"I was in need of a new versatile portable speaker to fit my summer adventures; one that was portable enough to fit in a beach bag and left in my car or to play out in my pool area that packed a punch in sound. After a week of owning this speaker, all in all it has checked every box.TLDR: This speaker, while a tiny bit smaller than what I was expecting, packs amazing sound quality from a trusted brand to easily liven up any outdoor occasion. Their app is great for EQ settings, however the physical ULT button provided great boost to your music by itself to hype up any outdoor event. Waterproofing is great and holds a good charge while being extremely portable with its carrying strap.Packaging:- The speaker arrived in a regular cardboard box. While it was nice to see Sony turn to the newer trend of making packaging as recyclable as possible, I did notice that the pieces holding the speaker were flimsy and could possibly be a concern during delivery. However, mine thankfully arrived in perfect condition. Included inside the box was the speaker itself with the carrying band already attached, a USB A to USB C charging cable, and a very small paper pamphlet. Instructions for the speaker are found through a scanned QR code within this pamphlet which allowed for more information about the speaker to be addressed.Sound Quality:- As to no surprise from this being from Sony, this speaker sounds amazing. It doesn’t get tinny at higher volumes, the dual drivers create amazing bass, and overall it covers all genres with no issue presenting truly enjoyable melodies for all music. At max volume, while the speaker does not get deafening loud if you are outdoors (indoors it possibly will depending on what you define as deafening lol), it certain gets loud enough to entertain a large area. In my 40 foot by 120 foot patio, this speaker shined and was the center piece of great sound quality and entertainment. While it certain suits my needs for loudness, you can always take it a notch up by either using the ULT button or pairing it with a second ULT Field 1 and working them in stereo (both discussed in features).Features:- This speaker is packed with all of the expected features of a modern Bluetooth speaker. It quickly connects to remembered devices when powered on (one nice little note: to power on/off this device, only a single press of the power button is needed for each. While a small detail, it truly is something that is appreciated for ease of use) and has a great battery life. While I cannot speak for the full I’ve gone 6 hours of using the speaker which left it at 50%, so I believe their claim of 12 hours of battery life to be true. This speaker also has a quick charger feature of 10 mins of charging for 3 hours of playback. I haven’t tested that myself as of yet, but I have other newer Song products with similar fast charging features and their claims for those products have not fallen short, so I believe these ones as well.- There is also a Bluetooth pairing button, a multiple use button that can play/pause tracks, skip/reverse tracks, and answer/hang up phone calls depending on need. Functionality was clearly a forethought of this speaker, since this button’s commands—while certainly vast—are greatly designed. Play/pause is a single press, skip is a double press, reverse is a triple press, and it converts to a call answer/hang up button with a single press functionality when you receive a call. There are also independent volume up/down buttons which increase the volume by a decent percentage in each press.- Then there is the ULT button, which is a built in EQ adjustment presented as a physical button on the speaker. It comes with default settings when pressed that noticeably enhance the all around sound quality of any melody, with an emphasis on bass and treble. The EQ for the ULT button can be adjusted in the Sony Music Center app. It’s a great feature to use when you want to give that extra boost to your music.- While I have not tried it myself, this speaker also has the ability to be set in stereo with a second ULT speaker, and I’m sure the dual speaker combination could easily work as a stereo set up for any venue needs.- The waterproofing of this speaker is on par with expectations. I’ve taken it to many water-based areas and have gotten it splashed with water and it’s been completely fine. The USB C charging port is covered with a water tight seal that you can open and close easily.- This speaker works with Sony’s music center app, and while it’s a bit rougher than their headphone app, it still works wonderfully to optimize the speaker’s functionality and performance. Full EQ settings are available, along with specific battery percentage, updates, and settings for the speaker.- The included carrying strap is a nice touch that, I will admit I did not initially think I was going to like, however it very quickly grew on me and I find myself carrying the speaker solely by the strap anywhere I take it. It is tied onto the speaker and can be removed, however you will have to re-tie it yourself if you want to reattach it.Build Quality:- Once again, as expected from this price point and the Song brand, this is truly a high quality speaker. It feels great to hold, with the fabric being sturdy and made of soft material. The buttons are covered in strong rubber that give a satisfying response when pushed. The carrying strap is thick and made of a high quality and very slightly elastic material. You are certainly getting your money’s worth on quality alone, which is what I expect from the Song brand.Final Thoughts:- While it is certainly understandable to hesitant when looking at a $120 Bluetooth speaker, this one truly is worth its value. I have very little complaints with this speaker, and think that it’s a great edition to anyone’s outdoor entertainment experience. The ULT button is a feature I find myself using more than expected (in a good way) to help boost my music during gatherings to help the entertainment. With its waterproofing, I feel comfortable using it as a travel speaker to any destination I plan on visiting. This feature packed speaker is truly one of a kind, and I’m certainly satisfied with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2024",AHWLZPJ4HLRGSDCGXHCEWVVOGX4Q,True,17,Color: Off White,2024-06-24,Off White,not listed,not listed

R3MI1MH02YEDHK,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Things I wish I knew before I bought this.,Pat,5,"The media could not be loaded. So, yes 5 stars, and I mean that. To cut to the chase, this is an excellent speaker, and you should get one!Now, I usually do not post reviews, but I thought if you knew all this, it would help you understand why I gave it 5 stars and recommend it so highly!SOUNDIt sounds way bigger than it looks. The ULT button adds a lot of bass and I love that! It is great for EDM, Hip hop, R&B, 80s, 90s,... I tried basically everything I could, and it all sounded great. Even added a little more depth to a classical cello playlist I listen to while I am working.If you like a less bass-heavy sound, just turn the ULT feature off, and it will sound excellent. If that does not suit you, there is a 3-band EQ in the app.OH, and it sounds just as good standing up as it does lying down!!APPAs mentioned, there is an EQ in there!! You can also change other settings and even see the battery life, which I could not believe was still 60% after a couple of days of me casually using it! Super surprised because I never charged it when I got it!Oh, I also noticed the ""group with other speakers,"" and apparently, you can pair another one of these and get stereo sound out of them.... I have not tried that, but I will as soon as I get my second one!STRAPThis was one I was really unsure about when looking at it online. The strap is genius! It can tighten or loosen and then stay in place. My little one liked to carry it around like a purse, but it is really versatile, and I found I could hang it one way or another everywhere I went.DESIGNAgain the design is great, it is very stable standing up or lying down. The buttons are easy to use and because they are raised, you can use them without even looking at them.The SONY logo on the front looks silver most of the time but actually has some... I don't know what, but it changes color, which is a nice touch. See pics.Love the Forest Grey color, it is exactly as expected. A subtle green/grey that I have gotten a lot more comments on than I ever though I would.LIFE/KID-PROOF!Ok, so I like music in the shower, and let me tell you... this thing delivers, even when it got wet it still sounded clear. I did not need to have it at full volume either.Of course, my girls heard it, and when it was bath time, they wanted to have it with them. That is when I discovered it could float!! Now it does not sound great that way, but it still played even after multiple ""accidental"" dunks in the tub! They also loved to see what they could put on the woofer part, and see it dance and fall out.Lastly it is stink proof, as well as mud, sand and waterproof... My daughters and I clean the pond behind our house, usually after big storms, and pick up plastic and other garbage we find. My 6 yo, who likes to hold the speaker as a purse, thought it would be a great idea to bring ""Ultra"" (that is what they named it) with us while we did so. As expected, it dropped into the stinky pond muck when a dragonfly landed on it, and she screamed and tossed it like a live grenade...after fishing it out, I rinsed it off with some dawn and the water hose and it was good as new.To say this has held up remarkably well is an understatement. It looks great, sounds great, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a portable speaker. Hope this review helps!!!","Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2024",AGCVXRAC7KRNWUCTJSFA2D44CDNA,True,51,Color: Forest Gray,2024-05-20,Forest Gray,not listed,not listed
R26O4F9FKNIYVG,B0CXL4FQBK,4.0 out of 5 stars Easy to pair.,Joseph C,4,Not a Bose flex link. But good for the price. ULT setting is a bit muffled. Base is good.

R1SSV73W8JIH5E,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Didn't expect the sound quality coming out of this bad boy,Mike Freeman,5,"After trying out Sony Wireless Speaker, I have to say, my family and I were impressed. My teenage son has always been a hard sell on design. He was sold. The shiny Sony logo caught his attention immediately.I was surprise on the sound quality. This is me speaking from comparing to a different Sony speaker I've owned in the past (xb23 is the model number, I think).The ""cool factors"" for me were: 1. push the ULT button to enhance the bass and clear highs that really bring out the music while hanging out in the backyard. 2. Strap - It allows me to hang the speaker on the patio umbrella and out of the way of things (see pic). 3. Setting it up was a breeze. Wifey opened up the box, push the power button, paired the bluetooth, all on her own. Lastly, what really stood out to me was how well-built this speaker is. It feels sturdy and durable, but it's lightweight enough to take with me wherever I go. Plus, the sleek design looks great.Haven't had it long enough to noticed any ""cons"" about this speaker. If I were to say something, I'd say price. I purchased the speaker at regular price because I needed a second unit for our backyard. I'd like to wait for the first sale to purchase 1 or 2 more for my family members with Mother's Day and Graduation around the corner.","Reviewed in the United States May 10, 2024",AFKMNV7MVRWKIXFNFEJOIYWBOUSA,True,13,Color: Off White,2024-05-10,Off White,not listed,not listed
R1CMFWUKND8EM,B0CXL4FQBK,"5.0 out of 5 stars Big sound, little package!!!",Mike,5,"This little speaker surprised me. This “ULT” button packs a punch, but not in the way you would think. Most of my past speakers with a boost button basically increased bass. It’s fine if that’s all you want, but the equalization isn’t there. The bass over-powers the voice or the other instruments. This ULT button gives you more bass - check , and the other sounds also get enhanced. It’s pretty remarkable. The strap is cool. I can hang it from the table umbrella in my back yard. Porting the side speakers was smart. You can use it horizontal like normal or when you stand it vertically, the bottom speaker isn’t fully covered. The air can go somewhere. I think Sony has a winner here. This is definitely coming pool side and beach side on our next trip to FLA. I got the white color. Looks good. I’m glad I picked this one. It’s definitely a keeper.Oh, all the other good stuff. Easy to connect to iPhone. 12 hour battery is very good for me and small for its power. Also works as a speaker phone and all the proofs. Beach proof and clumsy (me) proof.","Reviewed in the United States May 17, 2024",AHB6M2A23E4MMUH2H364AK7MX5IA,True,12,Color: Off White,2024-05-17,Off White,not listed,not listed
R2SOQ8N1C3X1JM,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Did JBL just lose?,Itryditm8,5,"The ULT field 1 is an incredible compact speaker. My Go-to was always the JBL flip series, as i right now own the flip 6.Design: The utility here is great, it has a carry strap that doubles as a hanger, or a handle!, the build is very rugged and high quality, i would not baby this thing at all, it handles its own!Sound & Performance: Out of the box the speaker comes with ULT on, and WOAH!, it gets very loud for its size!. This speaker connects to sony’s music center app, where you can customize the eq, connect in stereo to another field 1, and many other settings!. The sound is very open, clear on vocals ,it fills up a big room really well and maps the sound out. A really great sounding speaker. Battery life is really good,it varies how you use it, but real world use ( 50-80% volume, ULT on) its good for 8-10 hours straight. It does take a while to charge, about 5 hours if its completely drained. But thats good for the overall life of the battery.Compared to JBL flip 6: Ive been back forth between these two for the past couple days. And i found myself reaching for the field 1! It sounds better, its more open, it sounds like the music fills up any room, as for the JBL, it targets the sound directly at you, and the highs are a bit harsh, sony simply just outperforms it!Value: at retail ($128). I would buy this speaker no question. Its great and performs as well as speakers above its weight class.On sale : $98, i would buy it IMMEDIATELY:), insane value.","Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2024",AGNZEIEKV6LTFUK2YDPG7DPE6SHQ,True,3,Color: Off White,2024-05-27,Off White,not listed,not listed
RD4HR2I5R3X5R,B0CXL4FQBK,3.0 out of 5 stars Not very loud in certain circumstances,Chrissy0418,3,"This is a nice sounding wireless speaker. My issue is that it only turns up a little with my phone and tablet. If I'm listening to a talk and the person has a quiet voice, I can't hear clearly. Even with the device turned all the way up and the speaker itself turned all the way up. Music sounds great from this speaker. I do like the cord the speaker has on top so it can be hung. I don't think it was worth the price I paid for it. Maybe $50, but $99 I would expect better. So far the battery life has been excellent and it was easy to set up the Bluetooth. The size is perfect as well. It also works great recieving and answering calls.","Reviewed in the United States July 3, 2024",AEMERIUKJVKXEQ7EFZZKZWYUZJ4Q,True,5,Color: Black,2024-07-03,Black,not listed,not listed
R1P2OVKCR03MLZ,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars New Sony drop is perfect for budget audiophiles,BB,5,"If you're on the fence, get this! I was looking for a new speaker to replace my old UE Boom that had a static tick in it (love UE, but every speaker I've had goes this route eventually).This new portable Sony speaker didn't have the thousands of reviews that more expensive (or cheaper and well-known but risker) speakers had. However, every review was positive and they were right (so far). Though I've only had this about a month, it's been a massive improvement in my home and away music setup. The sound is gorgeous. The bass is clear and deep. I'm sure audiophiles can find a $1000 speaker that will be tuned to perfection, but for music fans without those funds (and who need a trusty travel speaker) this is the one.The forest green/grey looks cool and shows off how well-made it is.Only potential con so far is that it takes a while to shut off by itself. I don't have the Sony app so maybe this is a setting you can change. It's by no means a problem, unless you are banking on it shutting itself off. The connection lasts even if your music app closes which is nice.The rope handle also makes it so you can't just slam it down; it has to be the right orientation. It's tied loosely though, so you could untie it for more position flexibility, you'd just have a longer string to carry it.I am very particular and this speaker checked all my boxes! 10/10 recommend.","Reviewed in the United States July 20, 2024",AFBXJGYWY3QZXF2IZTRJYOW3UO7A,True,0,Color: Forest Gray,2024-07-20,Forest Gray,not listed,not listed
RJFBE7W2A9HWL,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Surprisingly Great!,Fabian,5,"What I was looking for was a compact bluetooth speaker that packs a punch in bass, so I decided to give this Sony speaker a try and boy was I surprised by it! 1. Bluetooth pairing - First, pairing this was super easy. I happen to have an Android phone and once bluetooth is on, it automatically pops up on my phone and asks if I want to pair it.2. Design - for a compact size speaker, it is really lightweight and because the speaker is shaped the way it is, it can easily stand up by itself or laid out sideways. The tether that comes with it can easily be strapped on to my backpack or a bicycle.3. Bass - The sound varies depending on the position of the speaker, but the bass is surprisingly good! The secret here is the ""ult"" button. Once you press that, it really amps up the bass while not sacrificing the clarity of the vocals. What I thought was cool was the companion app that you can use to control the speaker in which you can also customize the sound through the equalizer. I am not too picky when it comes to sound, but the opportunity to customize it will be super flexible for those who like their own sound.4. Sound Quality and Distance - This to me was the main reason why I am giving it 5 stars. The sound quality has really good range from the low tones to the high tones. I like to listen to the variety of different styles of music and I am very impressed of the sound reproduction of this speaker. Usually, I am not too far away from the speaker, but there had been times where I had to go downstairs to do something and what's nice is that the speaker had really good range for a bluetooth speaker. The sound never cut out once. As a bonus, what I discovered in the app, was an option to either turn on sound quality performance or focus on a stable connection and I think that will allow some people to really enjoy their music even from a far away distance.5. Price - $128 is still a lot of money, but for this amount of money and what I am getting from this speaker. I say it is well worth it because I can take this literally anywhere outside or inside. There have been a couple of times when my phone was paired to the speaker and somebody called in and I had a conversation with them not knowing I can actually talk to them from the speaker! So yes, if you can afford this speaker, I say give this a try! You won't be disappointed!","Reviewed in the United States May 15, 2024",AGCP3WP3ZNQM7W7TXE7ADU62LOXQ,True,15,Color: Black,2024-05-15,Black,not listed,not listed

R2TB41OYEQ665X,B099TJGJ91,5.0 out of 5 stars Simply great.,Jake,5,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my entire ownership of this speaker.Time of writing this review is roughly 8 months after purchase, having used this speaker practically every single day since. This was a replacement for a very well-loved but somewhat lacking B&O (P3?) oval-shaped speaker that inspired of few of my must-have features.My key requirements in purchasing a speaker at this price point were:- Punchy, solid bass, with high accuracy, clear playback throughout most of the volume range- Relatively attractive, understated, simple design with ergonomic and intuitive controls- Easily oriented for high quality playback in a variety of different situations (facing sideways, upwards, at angles)- Long-lasting battery without any obnoxious constant playback interruptions informing you of battery life remainingThis speaker delivers on all of these.The bass is incredibly clear, with no horrible warbling and distortion that’s very common with dozens of other similar speakers. The audio playback is very crisp and clear, with no noticeable quality losses. I’m sure it’s not perfect, but it’s more than adequate for 95%+ of people. Even at low volumes, the quality is still extremely high. There is a usable, enjoyable sound at every volume level.The design is simple, but handsome. It does not look obnoxious or out of place anywhere. It is just the right size, not too large to pop into a bag, and not too small as to have low-power drivers with poor sound. Very easy to transport. The squared design makes it very stable on most surfaces, but is still rounded enough not to get caught on things. The controls are very easy to understand, even the multi-device Bluetooth cycling and syncing. I have no complaints.The speaker works well for playback in nearly any position, especially when placed on a table or other nice playback surface. It can be placed facing upward, and the speaker enhances playback for all-around sound. When placed horizontally, the same happens for directional playback. Very impressive stability in a wide variety of situations. Some would consider the lack of a lanyard or string to be a downside for this point, but there is massive benefits to keeping this speaker on a surface.The battery life is incredible. Vastly longer than I had really expected for this speaker. With my personal usage (middle volume range, 2-3 uses a day for 30 to 60 minutes at a time), I usually recharge every 1-2 weeks. Not sure what exactly that equates to in real playback time, but I still find it impressive. The speaker will notify you at 20% and 10% battery level, which is exactly what I wanted. Many other speakers will interrupt playback at 75%, 50%, etc. I’ve not experienced any noticeable battery decay during my ownership, but I have only fully depleted and nearly fully recharged the entire time, with no “filling up” in between.Downsides do exist, but most are inconsequential for me.- The audible indicators that inform you of which device you are connected to can sometimes feel a bit sluggish, especially with long device names.- I feel the price point is still a bit on the high side for the value, but I feel I’ve more than gotten my money’s worth. I just like a good deal.- Volume occasionally spikes very high in certain scenarios when switching between devices, but is fairly easily turned down after a quick scare.I would highly recommend this speaker to anyone in the market for a speaker at this price point. This is an especially good deal on sale. If you’re still reading at this point, just get the damn thing on the way.","Reviewed in the United States May 4, 2024",AHZBIFMKWWZHILYEIYOSP4AIA37Q,True,227,Color: Black,2024-05-04,Black,not listed,not listed
R2Y3WBHYS3U0M4,B099TJGJ91,5.0 out of 5 stars A premium speaker in a sturdy package.,Reviewer MHM 3-5,5,"I bought this speaker because I wanted a way to listen to music while grilling in my backyard. I had no expectations of it being a “party” speaker or anything of the like.But my goodness. This speaker punched above the weight I expected and what reviewers claim. They say it’s good for less than 10 people. Probably true if in an enclosed space.Outside, standing in the corner of my backyard about 40+ feet away, the speaker volume is at about 60-70% and with the air conditioner droning on I can still hear this speaker, and the vocals are clear, the instruments are clear, and there’s even some punch of the bass. It’s so much more potent than I expected.I actually bought a second one (the one pictured) so I could utilize Party Mode and Stereo Mode, and then these are far better than they have any right to be. The bass shook through the house at about 40% volume, to the extent that my wife actually asked me to return one and get some noise cancelling headphones if I wanted to be blaring music all day. 😂So (for now), I’m obliging and returning one, but honestly, I don’t want to. One of these speakers are great. Two make a great portable stereo system.Now for the feature set. Key selling points for me were:1. Durability. It’s made of steel and silicone, is rated to withstand a dunk in water and dust. You can enjoy this in the yard, on your workbench, swimming, shower, etc. I live in high desert, and the wind blew over these speakers from a table to the ground and they didn’t have a single dent or scratch. Which leads me to…2. The device has sensors built in that detect its positioning, so the sound quality was maintained even if it’s on its back, side, or face down. None of the other products that compete in this segment offer that function to my knowledge.3. Unlike other products that I considered, this sounded good right out of the box. Anker (Soundcore) offers some great competition in this segment, but needs the EQ tweaked to shine. They’re not bad by any means, but I wanted things to just be simple. Power on and go without fuss. Bose delivered that.There are similar products for sure. Ultimate Ears will also let you pair two portables to create a stereo, but it lacked the intelligence that this speaker did.We already covered Soundcore. Tweak with the EQ, save some money, you’ll likely be happy.These speakers do often go on sale, and I purchased mine used (like new) and refurbished respectively. The “Used” unit was actually brand new from Amazon, broke the seals on the box and everything. Far as I could tell, the speaker just rolled around in someone’s trunk unopened before returning. The box had some cosmetic damage but no dents, broken seals, and all accessories were obviously also unopened.Refurbished unit came straight from Bose. Also came with all accessories and literature, just a box that was labeled “Refurbished”. Warranty on refurbished or new are 1 year regardless.I bring this up to encourage you to save some money, reduce some e-waste, and buy secondhand like I did. No judgments if you want to go new of course! But I got 2 speakers, one that was new in reality, essentially $100 off the set, and I didn’t miss out on anything in terms of product or warranty.$150 is pricey for a speaker, but $103 for a Bose speaker is not. Especially one that can literally go for a swim.Four criticisms I’d like y’all to know. First, compression above about 75% volume. Your bass will flatline above this point to maintain clarity of the track as a whole. In reality, that just means you go from a slightly warm tone to a very neutral tone of sound profile. No big deal unless you’re blasting EDM, Hip-Hop, the like. As I said, this little 20W speaker carries enough punch that 70% was more than enough to fill my backyard.Second criticism is no biggie for me, but worth bringing up for those shopping the competition. I didn’t want to fuss with an EQ, but competitors do have them to fine tune your sound. Consequentially, the app is basically useless beyond seeing your battery life and an option on how to do party mode (not required).Third criticism is truly a nitpick, but why do I have two apps for my Bose products? Why do I need one for headphones and one for speakers? Wish Bose would put all their portable speakers and headphones into one app. You could easily knock out criticisms 3-4 by just putting this speaker into the Bose Music app, like my QuietComfort Headphones, and this VERY speaker's big brother, the Soundlink Flex Max, is already there. Why the heck is the Soundlink Flex not in Bose Music, with a basic EQ like the others?Fourth, this uses outdated Bluetooth. No big deal. Pairs easily. But don’t expect to watch movies or game off of this. Latency is too high.Anyhow, enough of that. Go buy one. Or better yet, two. You won’t be disappointed.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AH5F7QHDE5VKRAMBN43A5WPU4ADQ,True,103,Color: Black,2024-07-02,Black,not listed,not listed

RQALUUYJSIT6A,B099TJGJ91,5.0 out of 5 stars Portable Speaker,Jose,5,"This is by far the best portable speaker I have ever owned. The sound quality is immaculate, with a bass that is incredibly smooth and buttery. I love it so much that I brought it with me to a small gathering. Even in a pretty large room, it played music beautifully, and people were impressed with the sound.Overall, this is a great speaker! It exceeds my expectations in terms of performance and sound quality. If you're looking for a reliable and impressive portable speaker, I highly recommend this one.","Reviewed in the United States July 28, 2024",AEA76CNGB75445PR4RJJZF3BHM6A,True,2,Color: Green,2024-07-28,Green,not listed,not listed

R3N5UYTNS8D2V6,B099TJGJ91,"4.0 out of 5 stars Small speaker, big sound, travel friendly",jonathan lopez,4,"Got this lil thing for Prime Day for only $99. I’m not going to lie, I had low expectations and planned on returning it. After opening it and setting it up, I got to see what the hype was about. Took me a couple hours of listening to figure out if it was a bang for my buck or a waste of money.I currently have the first UE Megaboom that I use daily that I bought back in 2016. It’s loud, has bass and can fill a room. Sadly, the charge isn’t exactly reliable so I was looking for something new. The Bose Link Flex definitely has a great quality sound. It will definitely fill a room. I like to use mine in the shower and acoustically in the shower the bass just sounds amazing!! Speaker actually fell off the shelf from the bass and survived the fall.Now, I listen to just about every genre of music. I found it to sound best with Latin music. Vocals are super clear. When it came to rap music (or music with lots of bass) I found it to sound perfectly balanced when the volume was at about 75%. Above that you’ll definitely still get volume but the bass will take a seat back. I’m used to the UE Megaboom that has 360 sound. While the Bose Link Flex will fill a room, the sound seems more straight forward depending if you want to stand it up or lay it down.Bose App is decent. Doesn’t really have any equalizer setting on there if that’s what you’re loooking for.I got this because it is small enough to pack in a carry on and not take up too much space in my bag. Might I add, it’s almost the same size as my iPhone 14 Pro Max . I can easily carry both in one hand. Easy to say, I’m going to keep this speaker with me. Now let’s see if the battery life is legit. I’ll check back in.","Reviewed in the United States July 18, 2024",AF35A3ETTRWH62AWEWFQ2GO27VJA,True,13,Color: Green,2024-07-18,Green,not listed,not listed

R3TVEXDLBORXWI,B099TJGJ91,5.0 out of 5 stars 5 Million Stars!! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,Caitriona Gillespie,5,"OMG this is the best speaker which is not a huge floor speaker (over 1 foot high) that is part of a massive speaker system. The sound quality is truly impressive for a speaker of any size, & I think that if I bought another one, which I'm seriously considering, it would rival my Kenwood stereo system, which has two floor speakers that are over a foot high each, & the Kenwood amplifier, & the Kenwood 5-CD player. All that stuff is so big that it needs its own cabinet & takes up several feet of floor space. I don't know how the geniuses at Bose have done it, but they have somehow packed all that sound into a speaker less than half the size of a loaf of bread that is also a very appealing shade of lilac that goes with my décor. The Bluetooth connection works perfectly every time, even though I don't have the newest phone out there. I'm so in love with this speaker, the only complaint I have is purely aesthetic & easily fixed- the fabric loop attached to this beautiful lilac speaker is, for some unknown reason, an entirely ridiculous shade of brilliant orange, which clashes hideously with everything. I solved this problem with a dark purple Sharpie marker. That is the only complaint I have. While this speaker comes without any instructions on how to set it up, the set up is so easy, even when you're not a technology person, that I set it up myself with no help in under a minute. I plugged it in, turned it on, turned the volume all the way up- for some idiotic reason, it comes with the volume all the way down- & then turned on the Bluetooth on my phone & had it search for Bluetooth devices. My phone found the speaker very quickly, paired with it without issue, & started playing. One important thing to know is that when you leave the range of the speaker for an extended period of time, like when I leave for work & take my phone with me, the speaker will turn that connection off, so that when I get home & want to use my speaker again, I need to go over to the speaker with my phone & push the power button once. The speaker will say how much battery power is left & that it is now connected to my phone- I don't turn the Bluetooth off on my phone when I leave the house. I recommend turning the speaker all the way up & then controlling the volume through your phone, which is what I do. I think that's the easiest way to do it. One charge of the battery lasts a long time- at least 12 hours, so that part's great as well. Just buy it already, you won't regret it. It'll beat the pants off of all of your other speakers, even if you already have a nice set of Bose speakers.","Reviewed in the United States June 15, 2024",AGKOCRUHY2FG2ZHWTZRUH5JYIFBA,True,19,Color: Chilled Lilac,2024-06-15,Chilled Lilac,not listed,not listed
R2TT1UU35P8I2W,B099TJGJ91,"4.0 out of 5 stars Surprisingly loud, no EQ controls, few caveats",Jacob Teeler,4,"Bought this for work (I run a forklift and JBLs just arent loud enough) and was pleasantly surprised by how loud it gets. Sound quality is fantastic at all volume levels, its durable and holds up pretty well to the elements. The battery does genuinely last a full 8-10 hour shift playing constantly. A few things to note however.There are no EQ controls for it. Sound is well balanced but theres no bass boost, treble, no nada built in.The app is unnecessary once you get it set up with your device, really only need it to check the battery. The speaker will tell you what its battery percentage is if you turn it off and on though.Max volume is entirely dependent on the device its paired to. If i pair it to my PC, max volume is pretty quiet. If i pair it to my buddy's phone it gets pretty loud, but nowhere near as loud as it is paired to my phone.Volume controls are independent from the device and speaker. You can turn your speaker volume to max but your device is the primary control. So if you have the speaker on low volume and your phone all the way to the max, it wont be as loud as both at max, and vice versa. Its very odd.It does not remember the bluetooth volume of the device its paired to, so if you turn it off and use it the next day, it has a habit of being at full blown volume by default. Just be mindful.Other than that, its excellent and no one will be disappointed by it.","Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2024",AHEGWVGORT2NYKVPVFMFBFDUYI7Q,True,2,Color: Black,2024-07-22,Black,not listed,not listed
R2SSSH04J4J264,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars Really nice portable speaker for the price. Solid buy!,Bruce C,5,"Needed a new portable speaker for the home setup and once I saw that Beats (read: Apple) came out with the new Beats Pill, I bit the bullet and purchased one.First things first, the unboxing experience and the design of the speaker is quintessentially Apple. Speaker has a nice heft to it and the design of the speaker is really nice, with the angled design, and the speakers facing you.If you are in the Apple Ecosystem, this speaker was made for you as it connects to your iPhone the minute you turn it on with a very satisfying screen animation. I'm told you can easily connect with an Android product too but I didn't have one in hand to test out how easy it was.The sound quality of this speaker is really great for its size, living up to the Beats name, filling the room with punchy bass and crystal clear sound. Rated IP67 meaning it is dust and water resistant, so you can feel confident taking it to your next beach party or when you are traveling. Battery life of this thing is stated at a whopping 24 hrs. I'll definitely be testing that claim, but if true, is completely mind blowing.But what sets this speaker apart, and one of the main reasons why I bought it, is that it also doubles as a speakerphone!!! I can connect this badboy to my laptop, and take crystal clear Teams calls with it all day at work. And when I'm done with my calls, since it is connected to my laptop via USB-C, I can listen to lossless music on Apple Music. Mind...blown!Run, don't walk, to buy this awesome speaker!!","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",AFVM53KRAU5JC462ZZDBBKTESPGA,True,9,Color: Statement RedStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+,2024-07-01,Statement Red,Pill,Without AppleCare+

Compared to all of them this is an amazing speaker for the price point. Bass is great. Clarity is great. Build quality is great. You can even hook it up via usb c to get lossless music. I didnt notice much a difference that way. Also if your in the apple eco system it works like AirPods where you can switch between devices and also locate the speaker via find my.

I could’ve went with Champagne as well and would’ve also fit. I compared to flip 6 right away, it is Brighter, crisper and deeper bass at 50% volume and lower.However at above 50% the bass becomes muddy, it has this weird flutter sound to it. The Flip 6 Still Sounds great at 50% and lower just it sounds a little quieter and less vibrant compared to the Pill.The Charge 4 and 5 are bigger speakers and has bigger woofers.The pill is definitely very portable, great performance and most definitely great value for the money.Maybe later down the road i will purchase another for stereo sound bars for our TV.","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2024",AHAMVBSECCNUJMQV6A3BO3A3HNMA,True,3,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+,2024-07-23,Matte Black,Pill,Without AppleCare+

R3AK5LLZ1VVTWJ,B08X4YMTPM,"5.0 out of 5 stars INSANE Speaker! Quality, volume, battery, and features make this THE BEST!",Jeremy,5,"The JBL Charge 5 is the BEST speaker I have ever owned. I have had the average run-of-the-mill bluetooth speaker that has around a $20 value, for over a year, and I thought it was good sound quality, and I never thought I needed something “fancy.” Well, that speaker started having problems, and I was carefully searching for another speaker. I found this speaker and I thought I would try something new. I only had one thought as I played music out of it for the first time. WOW! The JBL Charge 5 has the best sound quality I had ever heard from a bluetooth speaker. I don’t ever plan on getting another speaker; that is, a speaker that isn’t JBL or an upgraded version of the Charge 5. The clarity is absolutely stunning! The bass is DEEP. I can feel the bass through my whole room! The volume is insane. I rarely have it over 50%, but in the event where I need it louder, I turn it up. I once had music filling a whole event center that was quite a reasonable size. If I could choose one word to describe this speaker, it would be “Stunning,” “Powerful,” or “Supercharged!(Pun intended.)” On that note, the battery life on this thing is long! I once had the speaker provide some background noise for about two days and the battery life was barely lower than 70% (I think…it’s hard to tell exactly with the battery indicator; definitely above 60%). Of course, the battery drains quicker when you have the speaker playing at high volumes. Also, it can take some water. Some being a little, I prefer not to put it to the test. Here is my takeaway:DESIGN: 9/10 Great! I love the fabric covering. The JBL logo is made of metal, which makes it look very nice and official. The buttons are easy to distinguish, and the light is on the power, bluetooth, and there is a ring of light around those two buttons when PartyBoost is in effect. There is a battery bar right below the JBL Logo, and it serves as a general battery indicator. You can get the 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25%. You can get more info on the battery via the app. The weight is surprisingly light, considering the volume this speaker is capable of. Although, it isn’t the most portable of portable speakers as it is a little big and has a football shape. You can get a case for it that has a strap though. For the skip feature, you have to press the play/pause button twice. Make sure that when you do this, you maintain a consistent interval of time between the two presses. If you do it too fast it will just pause. If you do it too slow, it will just pause then play again.BATTERY: 10/10 Perfect! I absolutely love the battery. I’m the kind of person that prefers the longest possible battery, and doing whatever it takes to preserve it. I don’t have to worry much about this battery. Like I said, it has provided some low music for almost 2 days and the battery wasn’t that affected. However, the battery life will drain much more rapidly when using the speaker at high volumes. I currently use this speaker with a projector to watch TV. I have watched lots of movies and TV shows, and I don’t have to pay much attention to the battery. I just plug it in every other night, and it does great! And having a battery bank is the cherry on top. I haven’t used it much, as I keep most of my devices fully charged, but I think it is awesome that it has a battery bank if I need it.SOUND QUALITY: 10/10(10.5/10) Stunning! I didn’t expect that sound quality could get this good for a bluetooth speaker. JBL means business! When I turn it to high volumes, I can actually feel air blowing from it! On that note, it can go REALLY high in volume. I did not expect that at all. Insane volume. As stated earlier, I use this with a projector, and for all my TV. Watching movies with this speaker makes the entire experience cinematic! A much bigger upgrade compared to the sound TV’s come with. I would even say that it can contend with some soundbars out there (not the JBL Surround Sound System though…that one seems like the top-tier of JBL). This speaker was my first experience with JBL speakers (other than the car speakers) and I was very impressed. It has been the best sound experience I have ever had. Really clear and crisp audio, and when I say “really,” I mean truly! When playing music, I can hear every instrument, every breath, and incredible bass. The bass is a superstar in and of itself. Like I said, the bass shakes my whole room when playing music, and when watching movies! The side radiators really, really pack a punch! There is even an adjustable EQ on the app. Though I prefer what the speaker came with. It is a little pricey, (just a little) but know that you get what you pay for! I don’t think that I can ever go back to what I had…PARTYBOOST: 9/10 Great! I had one, so I bought two more so I could create a surround sound with my TV. It kinda worked. I think I had some sort of connectivity issue, so all I’ll say is that the range might not be that great, so make sure you keep them somewhat close. If you have a projector that has bluetooth and you want to use PartyBoost, I would consider researching what you can do with the Bluetooth latency (As stated earlier, I watch TV with this, and please note there IS some lag between sound and video, as bluetooth will do. However, that is just bluetooth technology, not JBL. Over time my ears and eyes have adjusted, and now it is not that big a deal). In addition to standard bluetooth latency, PartyBoost will make this delay greater (I ended up returning the other two because of this issue). For music, this is not a problem, because it is just sound and no video. With music, PartyBoost is pretty cool! It really creates a much louder and much cooler sound experience. You can even use just two for a stereo effect, and it works great!Overall, this has been the BEST bluetooth speaker experience I have ever had. You better believe I’ll be there for the Charge 6 or 7 or wherever they decide to take this. They really have something good going here. I would 110% recommend this! If you are reading this review, and you would like an upgrade to your typical listening experience, know that this is one of the best out there! And if you catch this at a discounted price, you’ll know you are getting a great deal. JBL has been the best listening experience for me. I will continue buying their products if they keep supplying a high-quality experience. I mean, let the 27,000 ratings with a 4.8 overall rating speak for itself. Here is a simplified pro-con list:PROS-Excellent audio clarity-Excellent bass-Excellent overall sound-Exceptional volume-Long battery life-Battery bank feature-Waterproof feature-Adjustable EQ-Stereo Effect-PartyBoost for multiple speakersCONS-Button timing for the skip track-Could be slightly more portable (We do have the Flip speakers for that though)","Reviewed in the United States April 5, 2024",AEDM32EKQE2HOHUCSXFF2Z27F7NQ,True,69,Color: Black,2024-04-05,Black,not listed,not listed
R158T5SJCSV7IQ,B08X4YMTPM,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Sound and Great Durability,Miguel Gomez,5,"The media could not be loaded. I recently got my hands on the JBL CHARGE 5 Portable Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker, and I have to say, it’s been an awesome addition to my music setup. Whether I’m chilling at home, heading to the beach, or just hanging out in the backyard, this speaker has been delivering on all fronts.First off, let’s talk about the sound quality. It’s impressive! The audio is clear and crisp, making everything from podcasts to my favorite tracks sound fantastic. The bass is particularly noteworthy – it’s deep and punchy without being overwhelming. I’ve had other portable speakers before, but this one definitely stands out in terms of delivering that full, rich sound we all crave.The build quality of the JBL CHARGE 5 is also top-notch. It feels solid and durable, which is exactly what you need in a portable speaker. I’m not the gentlest person with my gadgets, so knowing this speaker can withstand a bit of rough handling is a huge plus. The waterproof feature is a game-changer too. I’ve taken it to the pool and the beach, and it’s held up perfectly fine even after getting splashed. No worries about a bit of water ruining the fun.Another awesome feature is the battery life. With up to 20 hours of playtime, this speaker keeps the party going all day and night. And the powerbank USB charge-out is a lifesaver! I can charge my phone on the go, which is super handy during long outings or when I forget to charge my phone beforehand. JBL PartyBoost is another cool feature that lets you pair multiple JBL speakers for an even bigger sound. I haven’t tried it yet, but it sounds like a blast for larger gatherings.Honestly, I’ve struggled to find any real cons with this speaker. It’s a bit on the heavier side, but considering the sound quality and battery life, it’s a trade-off I’m happy to make. The price is a bit higher compared to some other portable speakers, but you’re definitely getting what you pay for in terms of quality and performance.In conclusion, the JBL CHARGE 5 is a fantastic portable speaker that’s worth every penny. With clear, clean sound, excellent bass, and high-quality materials, it’s perfect for anyone looking to amp up their music experience. Whether you’re an audiophile or just someone who loves good tunes on the go, this speaker won’t disappoint.

R20JW8VDOEC2BP,B08X4YMTPM,5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect Mid-range Bluetooth Speaker,REDBLINKER,5,"This speaker is my 3rd JBL. I first bought the JBL Pulse 5 speaker awhile back, and I really love that one, especially for the light show it can do, but it's a little large to pack up and haul. Then I bought the JBL Flip 6 which is smaller, but still can pack a nice punch... but only if you turn it up really loud. I really love the JBL Flip 6 because it is extremely portable, but I decided that I wanted to try this JBL Charge 5 because I love the camouflage pattern on it, and it seemed like a good in-between speaker from the other two speakers I'm comparing here. As it turns out, the JBL Charge 5 is the best choice for me in terms of portability, and sound. It's got a really nice full sound, and I don't have to turn it up quite as loud as the JBL Flip 6 to achieve the full sound I like. That means to me that I have more volume to play with if I really jam out to some good music. In the future I would like to try the JBL Extreme, even though I know it's not as portable as these other speakers I have. Anyway I really love this JBL Charge 5, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a bluetooth speaker that can get loud, but offers easy portability.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2024",AFE42LBIADDXKHZ66MQRD7DE7JYQ,True,0,Color: Camouflage,2024-06-24,Camouflage,not listed,not listed

RL16ZWDRDNUEI,B09XXW54QG,5.0 out of 5 stars Great product with usage caveats,Omar Enrique Ferrer,5,"A few months ago I had an epiphany. When I was a kid my father loved to have the best in sound equipment in the house, and I would play with graphic equalizers and lay in the floor looking for the best position between the giant speakers to experiment how to better enjoy the music.Today, I hear music in monophonic audio in an old JBL Charge 3 speaker (don't tell my dad, he would be ashame of me).So I started to get better equipment. Now, I live in a small apartment with thin walls in a 3rd floor, so, big amplifiers and so are out of the question, but at least I could get better bluetooth speakers, so I tried the Marshall Emberton II.To say that I impressed with the sound would be an understatement. With out-of-the-box settings, the sound is more than detailed. 80s and 90s music sound outstanding although, Peter Cetera's Glory of Love and Toto's Africa vocals sound as I never heard them before, they are sharp and strong, sometimes detracting just a little from the overall sound (keywords here, really, just a little).This brings me to my first recommendation: do not mess with your applications equalizers if you don't know what you are doing. This speakers were clearly designed to use the manufacturer equalizer settings (more on this later). I have youtube music and amazon prime music (yeah, I know, no spotify), and my sound with the latter was to heavy on bass, to the point of drowning the music and feeling almost distorting. Tron: Legacy's soundtrack sounded specially dreadful, as Daftpunk uses heavy bass in their electronic music for that specific music. I then set the equalization in Amazon Prime Music to flat. It was a different performance altogether. I could ever hear some slight effects they used, that I had not noticed before.Now, one down for the application. Bluetooth pairing used Google Fast Pair, which was seamless and impressive (it shows appears to be a custom Marshall little window, so, it looks cool), but the application takes forever to actually ""discover"" the device, even when it is already paired.When it finally discover it (which was not too long, but took a couple of turning on and off the speaker), the application notified me of a firmware upgrade, which I proceeded to install. The installation failed miserably, so, I temporarily stopped that effort, which I retook successfully a day later. The update was surprisingly big in size, taking around 5 minutes to download, and the application simply marked the update successful while the speaker was still rebooting, which took a few seconds more than what I feel comfortable with, but it went through, and after that, the application again took surprisingly long to detect the speaker.To end that topic, the equalization settings are definitely underwhelming, with only three modes: Marshall, Voice and Push, of which I have only tried Marshall as everybody else says that Voice is just for podcast and such and Push increases bass at the expense of all the other sound bands quality.Lesson learned: unless too picky, when using this speaker, leave your apps equalizers on flat, their profile is that good.Now, to the hardware itself, people will notice this little wonder. Using the nostalgia factor with the Marshall amplifier design was a touch of genius, and the brass button on top is the cherry on top. Some reviews complain about a single button approach to multifunction (power, volume, forward-back, bluetooth pairing has another almost invisible button, which fits because you are not changing your pairing frequently). If we can handle touch control on over-head and in-ear speakers, this button is a piece of cake.My only complain in this department is that, at least for me, an old guy, the signs indicating the functions around the button, being carved in the black speaker, which has texture, are for all intent and purposes invisible, but once you get accustomed, an use the logo as a positional reference that's not a problem anymore.And finally, the little caveat. Single speaker, stereo sound. Let that sink in.Done? Ok, they achieve this trick by separating the sound left and right with drivers back and front respectively (or was it the other way around? well, you get my point). Stereo suffers a little (not too much) because both sources are incredibly close, but it brings this caveat. This speaker should not be set as others, against walls, like in shelf, and so, because you end up drowning one side.The best position for this speaker is in the center of the audio stage, and if you want to appreciate the sound, you should point one side (not the front or back) to you. that way both sources are equally distanced from you so you get a better balance.If you are ok with the caveats this product is worth the price, I definitely recommend it.","Reviewed in the United States October 1, 2022",AEFUDKDNGZTOEP2BCFB4CLUELCYQ,True,156,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II,2022-10-01,Black & Brass,Emberton II,not listed

R1N4D4CK1JMIVB,B09XXW54QG,4.0 out of 5 stars Three + 1/2 stars.,Sophie's6,4,"Feels churlish to give just three stars. 3.5 imo. So to the point. I bought this Em II to mainly listen to my true crime podcasts in my bedroom. Easy & seamless Bluetooth connection to my iPhone 14max. Easy straightforward use for controls on the unit. I really didn’t need to look at the instructions with that. Smooth use there.To test the sound quality I streamed some mesic. The sound quality for music is fine’ish considering the size of speaker. It’s fine for background music if you’re flexible on sound quality as long as you don’t play loudly, at that point the music will frazzle out. So limited, not surprising. Podcast quality is definitely an improvement from my phone’s speaker and in line with the price point, in general. I think it should be about $25 less. The app is useless. I guess I expected something from the app. I’m at a loss for the point of it. I tried it out on my phone. It continued so say my phone Bluetooth was not on. Even as I was literally playing music through it. I did all the stuff. Restart, reconnect etc. Reviewed the booklet, Nothing. Everything re the speaker and phone working fine. But what is the point of the app? I interpreted from the manual that I should download the app to get extra features. Maybe bass and treble controls? The book claims you can stack more speakers through the app but I would not invest in that as it continually says my phones Bluetooth is off. lolFine retro look, sturdy, small footprint and working out for podcasts. Do not think the app is or will be helpful.If I were to try another I’d probably go with the Klipsch of similar design. It’s approximately $50 more but better sound and working app.Remove $25 dollars off price on the Em II and it’s a fair deal.","Reviewed in the United States February 28, 2024",AHIQF7PWHKOE36B564CMAEITLRDQ,True,9,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II,2024-02-28,Black & Brass,Emberton II,not listed

RVQU04O5Y7EP5,B09XXW54QG,4.0 out of 5 stars Rich sound - with the right music,Brett Williams,4,"What I liked most about this unit was the dual driver system where you can get a more stereo sound than other Bluetooth speakers that are more mono (unless you pair a few together). The battery lasting up to 30 hours is impressive, though I didn't just it more than a few hours and couldn't speak to what real-time is. The top metal multi-directional button is very nice and premium feel......however the textured top/rubber surround makes reading the Volume/Track directions virtually impossible to see - you get used to it, but it would be nice if they were a little more visible.I will say that I'm disappointed in 2024, we're still seeing devices with Bluetooth 5.1, considering that it was released in 2016 and 5.3 has been out since 2021.With the driver's front and back-firing, I found that I got a wider sound by turning the unit sideways so that I was looking at the side of the unit while the drivers fired left and right.I listen to just about anything, and other were songs where the speaker excelled, but then others where it sounded very flat, and it's because of the inconsistency that I returned it. I will say that I liked it much more than the JBL's that I tested against which had almost zero depth comparatively, but for a little more I got something that, while larger, has a better sound presence.I was tempted to keep this as an alternative, but I think over time I would probably get annoyed with some songs sounding flat and others very deep and rich (or course tracks and recording quality matter, but compared to other speakers I tested I didn't see as big of a swing between the same songs).","Reviewed in the United States June 5, 2024",AEZLB3QWTROAPNV3SIQVKNOFDS3Q,True,2,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II,2024-06-05,Black & Brass,Emberton II,not listed

Does not take much for them to be loud. Only thing that could be improved is the renaming of the Bluetooth device. When you rename in your Bluetooth settings, that name does not transfer over to the UE App or vice versa. So you have to rename the same device in two different places.

R3FXXMYB4LCBKF,B07DD3WBYW,1.0 out of 5 stars The worst speaker every when used as two or more together,Charles Magnuson,1,"The media could not be loaded. I have two opinions of the Ultimate Ears Boom speakers.When used as a single speaker, the Ultimate Ears Boom 3 speaker works well. The sound quality and loudness are good for a speaker of its size. The Bluetooth range is rather pathetic as I lose connection after moving about 20 feet away from the speaker's audio source, but I blame Bluetooth for being a lousy wireless standard more than the speaker for that fault. The speaker can be used every day in the shower with no negative repercussions. Overall, the Boom 3 speaker is a great speaker when used by itself.The situation completely changes when attempting to use two or more Boom speakers together. I'll go into details below, but I can confidently say that I've experienced few pieces of technology that are more unreliable and frustrating than the Boom 3 speakers when trying to get them paired together and playing the same audio.First, the Ultimate Ears Boom app is a huge frustration. Getting even a single speaker to show up in the app can require multiple disconnects, app force quits, and speaker restarts. Once a primary speaker shows up in the UE Boom app, getting other speakers to show up is near impossible. Each and every day I want to use the speakers together, I have to go through a 20-minute process of forgetting Bluetooth settings, repairing, and powering off and on speakers. It is such a frustrating process that I usually rage quit and forgo using the speakers together.Then, once the speakers are connected together they regularly start clicking and thumping as they stutter during audio playback. Even when I move the two speakers within a foot of each other and the audio source, they regularly and constantly stutter and lose bits of audio. Listening to an entire song without missing parts is impossible when using the Ultimate Ears Boom speakers together in Party Up or Two-Up mode.Simply put, THESE SPEAKERS DO NOT WORK WHEN PAIRED TOGETHER. The Boom speakers are completely worthless when used together as the audio they play is unlistenable.I really enjoyed the single Ultimate Ears Boom speaker I used on its own for about two years, but after experiencing the disaster which is Party Up mode and the Ultimate Ears Boom app, I will never again purchase another Ultimate Ears product. This experience has just been too frustrating and I've wasted $300 on two speakers I cannot use together.","Reviewed in the United States November 2, 2018",AFN57XUWIRHZ24FA7IVOW5HXLL2Q,True,283,Color: Sunset RedPattern: Speaker,2018-11-02,Sunset RedPattern: Speaker,not listed,not listed
R3E39REOEKMJHO,B07DD3WBYW,2.0 out of 5 stars DO NOT BUY: Ruined my relationship with ULTIMATE EARS :(,Hailey DeArruda,2,"💗Let me start by saying before buying this product I have been a HUGE, longtime fan of the Ultimate Ears brand.I purchased the original Wonderboom portable bluetooth speaker maybe 5 years ago or longer? I originally purchased it because I wanted something waterproof that I could use in the shower. It was GREAT for that purpose, and also proved to be an awesome all-around portable bluetooth speaker. Sound quality was great for the price range and size. Volume was SUPER as well. I loved the big loop on the back that you could hang on all sorts of things. I LOVE the concept of the Magic Button in the center to Play, Pause & Skip. The Skip Feature is ESPECIALLY hard to find on a speaker in this price range and I love it for use at work when I may not be able to easily access my phone. Bluetooth connection was great. Battery life originally lasted anywhere between 4-6hrs at least which was great. THIS SPEAKER LASTED ME AT LEAST 5 YEARS with little to no change in quality. I LOVED THIS SPEAKER! Unfortunately, I left it at work one week when I was on vacation and just left it there figuring my coworkers could use it and would respect it enough. Long story short, I came back and it wasn't working as well or holding a charge properly. It was a sad end to a good story.🔍Finally, I find myself in need of a new speaker. Because I LOVED my original WONDERBOOM so much, I decided to search within the Ultimate Ears line.((It also just so happens at my current job our department owns two WONDERBOOM2 speakers! I've noticed their battery life doesn't work as well, but they still worked pretty decent.))So I wanted one of the newest, nicest speakers in the Ultimate Family. The Hyperboom was too large to transport from home and work, and cost way more than I was looking to spend, so that was out of the question. So immediately I decided to research between the BOOM3 & the MEGABOOM3. In conclusion, through reviews I read I concluded that most consumers felt the bass was overpowering for the Megaboom3 with no real volume increase, and simply diminished the quality of the sound. SO, I DECIDED TO PURCHASE THE BOOM3!1️⃣🆕First impression out of the box, it looked nice enough. I preferred the more compact design of the Wonderboom, and DEFINITELY missed the larger, more practical loop. It still has the magic button which is a HUGE selling point to me and very accommodating.I charged it up to 100% and decided to unplug it and test it out for a while at home. It worked well, sounded almost exactly like the Wonderboom as far as sound QUALITY. I might be wrong but as far as VOLUME goes I feel it may have had the same volume limitations as the original Wonderboom, if anything maybe SLIGHTLY louder. However, I was happy it seemed to be fully functioning and worked just as well as my other one.I also liked that in addition to that, I was able to use the Ultimate Ears app in conjunction with the product to REMOTE START the speaker from my phone. Again, this is another HUGE selling point to me because I mainly use this product at work. It also has an EQUALIZER function which is definitely cool, although I don't feel like it's very accurate. It also has some sort of feature where you can set certain clicks on the Magic Button to play certain playlists automatically, which sounds cool although I never got to personally try it.All in all, it seemed like a good replacement at first.⚠️🪫THE NEXT DAY COMES & HERE IS WHERE THE PROBLEMS BEGIN. I come into work with my charger FULLY charged at 100%. I use Remote-Start on the app to turn on the speaker. The Remote-Start feature also displays the approximate battery percentage (by 10% increments) of the speaker. At this point, my speaker was at 100% charge.I used the speaker for between 1.5hrs<2hrs before it gave me the Low Battery warning for 10%. So, I put it on the charger and continued to let it play. It lasted maybe another 20minutes, before it died.Now this is VERY disappointing considering my ORIGINAL WONDERBOOM that came out 5+ years ago would last for 4-6hrs on FULL VOLUME without being on a charger. Not only that, but the ORIGINAL WONDERBOOM would ALSO last for a WHILE on the charger even when battery wasn't full.This was disappointing, but didn't seem like a crisis, just a bit sad.The next day, is when the BIGGER issue began. I admittedly forgot to charge my BOOM3 when I got home the night before, and then brought it to work. When I wake up, I charge it until I leave for 1.5HOURS!When I arrive at work, I charge it for an additional 1HOUR before, checking the battery percentage on the app which reads 60%. So, I decide to turn it on and use it while STILL LEAVING IT ON THE CHARGER. NOT EVEN 30 MINUTES GO BY UNTIL THE SPEAKER DIES!!!!!!!!! So, irritated I turn it off, opt for my AirPods and leave the speaker to charge for a few hours. I let this SPEAKER CHARGE FOR 4 MORE HOURS BEFORE USING IT. Finally, I check the battery on the app which only says 40%????? So I turn on the speaker and leave it plugged in, IT LASTS FOR LESS THAN ONE SONG BEFORE DYING!LET ME TELL YOU, THIS SPEAKER BROUGHT OUT PURE RAGE IN ME AT WORK. 🪫⚠️😡I feel so pissed, and cheated and ripped off. I was such a big fan and advocate for the Ultimate Ears brand, but how are you gonna sell me a NEWER, MORE EXPENSIVE speaker and MAKE IT SIGNIFICANTLY worse. Considering this is the BOOM3, I WOULD HOPE & ASSUME IT IS GOING TO BE BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL WONDEBOOM FROM 5 YEARS AGO, BUT I GUESS NOT. Thanks, Logitech, just charge me more money for a FAR INFERIOR PRODUCT, with the illusion that is going to be somewhat improved. However; this speaker is simply, for my needs- UNUSABLE & FRUSTRATING!!! HUUUUUGE DOWNGRADE 👎😢Very, very disappointed in the Ultimate Ears brand for putting out this one. Like I sad it really is a shame because I was a HUGE supporter of their brand and unfortunately this product was so disappointing and frustrating that it has ruined my relationship with this company for good.I loved the convenience of the Magic Button with the Skip Feature, the portability, durability, great waterproof technology, super big, useful loop, the sound quality & volume, and the battery life of ORIGINAL WONDERBOOM, but this product has ruined all that unfortunately.⚠️DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND SAVE YOUR MOMEY 💸 BECAUSEYOU WILL NEED TO RETURN IT & REPLACE IT WITH ANOTHER SPEAKER!!!!!!! THIS SPEAKER IS NOT FUNCTIONAL! ⚠️Sorry, Ultimate Ears, but do better.","Reviewed in the United States November 17, 2022",AFSWDPDFGUZCY4TIBMKU2QD3275A,True,148,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker,2022-11-17,Night BlackPattern: Speaker,not listed,not listed

Imagine my surprise when this small SoundLink Mini didn't even come close to the sound quality of the older variants.I still have my original Soundlink Mini II from years ago but the USB micro port was starting to show it's age. Even with new cables, it often struggled to recognize when the charging cable was attached, and I've since lost the charging baseplate.This new one feels similar in construction with the added bonus of a TYPE C USB port. However, once on and playing music (synthwave, oldies, alternative) the low ends sound hollow and completely washed out compared to the old Soundlink. We tried both side by side and the older model is MUCH sharper and sounds much clearer in the low as well as mid range.The new one doesn't even come with a complete charging system, just a TYPE A to TYPE C usb cable.Huge disappointment for fans of the days when BOSE was king of the sound hill.EDIT: Amending review to 1-star after keeping the device playing for several hours.

R2KX6SPZ5R6EHA,B07YBN9XXG,3.0 out of 5 stars Planned Obsolescence,NC Steve,3,"I loved this speaker. For such tiny speakers, it had amazing sound. Quality construction, well-integrated features and charger. We owned this for five years before trouble started.A little background: I'm an avid DIYer, and a retired electronics technician. I appreciate good sound quality but, being in my 60s and having played lots-o-loud music, I can say that my hearing isn't up to that of a thirtysomething but to my wife and I the sound was great for such a tiny speaker. Of course, it's not going to outperform a 100W receiver with a pair of bookshelf speakers but it's darned good.And I don't think that I'm being overly demanding for kvetching about something that gave me 5 years of use having come up short. My reasoning is that this speaker cost over $200 in a world that now contains competitive products for under $50.When the Li ion battery gives up the ghost, you can't run it on the charger. It won't turn on. Period. So I started looking for a replacement battery for it and thought everything was going to be fine. Unfortunately, Bose decided to change the superior design of their earlier soundlink battery to an inferior design. You see, the original Soundlink had a drop-in battery. Pull the rubber off the bottom, pull the battery out, drop in a new battery, tighten screws and replace bottom. Done.The Soundlink II has a battery that requires one to tear the whole speaker apart and solder the cable to the circuit board (or splice the cable). Yeah, I can do it but I've seen (and experienced) too many bad replacement batteries -- some of which I have purchased and installed. I can get a new replacement battery for around $40 and spend one or two hours doing the job -- or I can buy a very close equivalent for $40. I have enough electronics to repair here, so I'm taking the easy way out. I would have been more than willing to buy a drop-in battery but oh, well.","Reviewed in the United States July 4, 2022",AGANQOTNO673FH2GJGJSMG2JADZQ,False,25,Color: Luxe Silver,2022-07-04,Luxe Silver,not listed,not listed

I was very disappointed in the lack of any high end to the sound. It was very flat. In addition, it is not considered a ""smart"" speaker so won't connect to the Bose Music or Bose Connect app and there is no way to adjust the tone.

R2ZVSKE86LPE5Q,B07YBN9XXG,5.0 out of 5 stars Greatness can come in small packages,Patrick Lacson,5,"I've tested multiple bluetooth devices from JBL, Anker, Amazon (China knockoffs) and Bose just sounds so much better. The special edition is an older device isn't water proof, is heavy, and doesn't have USB charging ports for your phones. However if you want amazing sound get this speaker.Bose has set itself as the gold standard when it comes to well-built devices. I bought mine refurbished and my goodness the sound compared to all my other BT speakers was just a night and day difference. The clarity of the voices and the bass are unmatched. The device is surprising heavy for such a smaller speaker. I believe that's due to the heavier magnets for the speakers.Some have complained (and I agree) that the speakers are a bit on the bass-heavy side. I do understand it does cater to more of an R&B tuning with heavy bass. But with software EQ the bass can be trimmed out and the audio is perfect.The battery life is amazing. 2 full days of non-stop use and still have 50% battery life. We were painting the house and had this on blast for those 2 full days of 10 hour work sessions and on the 3rd day still have plenty of juice to keep going.It does support multiple devices connected to the speaker so my wife and I can share the speaker with our Spotify account and can even ""join"" a music session.Buy this speaker.

This speaker really kicks and has amazing sound quality for its size. The battery has lasted all this time and holds a charge for about 6-8 hours of play at a loud volume (much longer if playing at a lower volume).I especially like this speaker for outdoor use (despite it not being waterproof) when picnicking or camping. It has a great directional range but doesn’t disturb people that are nearby (more than ~10ft away). I use it in my backyard a lot too and the neighbors can hardly hear it when I have it going loud. This speaker is pricy but if you’re an audiophile I highly recommend it, even with the audio limitations of Bluetooth.","Reviewed in the United States February 9, 2023",AHWS7DACUTQCVGGWQF65ATPKYMBQ,False,0,Color: Luxe Silver,2023-02-09,Luxe Silver,not listed,not listed

R13A8CEV5KJI8M,B09XXW54QG,5.0 out of 5 stars So Cool...,John Farrell,5,"I visited a friend on Florida recently and he's building a new house. We went over there to enjoy a few cocktails, it won't be done until May 2024, and brought along his Bang & Olufsen bluetooth speaker and took turns playing songs with our phones while we enjoyed our adult beverages on the water. I don't seem to have the same opportunities to use a bluetooth speaker, but I was very impressed with the B&O speaker. It rocked. I came back to NJ and wanted to get one for myself. These things aren't cheap (the good ones anyway) so I decided I was going to get one during the Black Friday sales. The B&O software, that enables you to pair with their speaker, was a pain in the neck. They were hounding me and sending me e-mails and all the rest. I wanted another alternative. I watched several YouTube videos and was introduced to this Marshall bluetooth speaker. They had me at designing this relatively tiny speaker to look like a real Marshall speaker. Once I read enough reviews I took the plunge. I think I got it on sale for around $120 when all was said and done. It showed up two day later. I pulled it out of the package, charged it up and paired it with my phone. Hate me (or them), but the first song I played with Help On The Way/Slipnot! from Blues For Allah (Grateful Dead). Wow. Absolutely loved the sound and the look. Down the road I will look into either ""stacking"" another one (they have that ability) or just getting a bigger speaker for another potential setting, but right now this thing rocks. If you go camping or just wanted to eat lunch at an outdoor picnic table with some music, this is for you. I'm impressed. I was a bit surprised that it seems as though your phone volume max is also the speaker volume max, but that might be a function of me not understanding how bluetooth actually works. I was kind of thinking I could leave the phone on mid volume and let the bluetooth speaker provide the amplification juice. That doesn't appear to be the case, but it's plenty loud enough in a vacuum. It's a starter speaker so I don't expect it to compete with something an outdoor waterfall or heavy traffic or even a tailgate party where everyone is blasting their tunes, but I'm very satisfied short term. Buy with confidence.","Reviewed in the United States January 10, 2024",AFHFRU22UQRFPEVWBHQFXHBHVYWA,True,3,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II,2024-01-10,Black & Brass,Emberton II,not listed

R1EA1XXVYAUBNB,B09XXW54QG,"5.0 out of 5 stars A simple, solid speaker",L,5,"If you want great sound in a simple package, this bluetooth speaker will do the trick. Initially I found the control button kind of fiddly, but now that I have the hang of it I can manage it easily.Mostly I use this at home when watching movies or listening to the news with some music thrown in. A serious audiophile would probably want a speaker that allows for more control, but the sound profile suits my needs.I've had very little trouble with the speaker losing its connection. There are only a couple of spots in my apartment (~600 sq ft) where the connection breaks up; fortunately, the connection is solid everywhere else, particularly in those rooms where I mostly want to use it.Build quality feels good and solid, like it's going to hold up for a long time. The speaker did get a light spray of water on it one day when I'd left it on my balcony and it suddenly began to rain, but the speaker was just fine.Of course Marshall has a reputation for quality sound gear, but the price still feels a little high given how simple this is. However, if you can get it on sale (as I did) and bring the price down under $100, I think it's worth it.","Reviewed in the United States February 20, 2024",AE23D3SJBYXFUO7OXEAFXXTU2IPA,True,3,Color: BlackStyle: Emberton,2024-02-20,Black,Emberton,not listed

Even though my daughter kept telling me to get a JBL.I love the look of this little Marshall, classic! But, I probably should have listened to my daughter.The sound is decent to good. There is no ability to toggle any sort of EQ. So the sound you hear, is the sound you get. The thing that I like least about this speaker is the function button. There is only one that you depress in N,S,E, and W for different abilities, but it is loose. It wobbles around like a loose tooth. I would prefer a nice tight button that snaps in each direction.

R1PKWJ1ZABTB2S,B09XXW54QG,"5.0 out of 5 stars Love, love, love, and love...",Su Doki,5,"So good, I bought two instead of one Marshall Middleton. As wanted, I pair them together to get surround sound, smaller size, and save about $50. Although I own two pairs of Marshall headphones which I'm taking with me to Heaven, at that time - it took awhile for me to commit to buying the speakers. That's because I already own a pair of off-brand Bluetooth speakers that sound so much better and lasts many hours longer than more expensive Beats, Bose, Sony, etc. They have all the other bells-and-whistles specifications, including USB-C, rapid charging, 20+ hours playtime and only cost $30 each. The seller stopped selling them on Amazon.Emberton II was a huge jump in price. The difference from Emberton I - is it will pair with other Marshall speakers. But only the latest models like the Middleton or more Emberton IIs. Also, the Emberton II has a grain texture finish. The hardest part about buying Marshall products is knowing if you actually got authentic products. Knock-offs provide knock-off quality and it hurts the reputation of genuine products with bad reviews. I won't describe the differences in great details. The box is printed on all sides that spills over to other sides. It looks and feels real money, very expensively printed. Inside packaging and booklets too. The speaker is very well crafted down to the smallest details and feels solid. The grills are finished very well, individually, without any rough edges or mistakes and so is the Marshall signature emblem. Look closely.The Emberton II sound quality is phenomenal for all music genres. It's a work of art pumping out sound, spatially separating all the tracks of instruments and voices, to hear them together in one song. This is studio quality at a reasonable price. It exceeds my $30 pair, which already beat-out all the other more expensive speakers, in the only way it could. I heard sounds playing in music I've heard so many times, I can replay it verbatim in my head. Some folks might scoff at this price point comparison. But if I'm completely satisfied at $30 or $170 - no one can entice me to spend $1500 or $15,000 I can afford to pay too. I might purchase more Emberton II's to install wireless speakers throughout the house. For now, I'm pretty satisfied.","Reviewed in the United States March 29, 2023",AFG3MMBXL5ODHUR3EXHWYGOHLNXA,True,22,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II,2023-03-29,Black & Brass,Emberton II,not listed

Traveling 90% of the time, I was tired of jamming things in my ears or feeling like I had a sauna on my head with over-ear headphones.I've tested the heavy hitters – B&O, Sonos, Bose, Megaboom (more like Mega Joke), Anker – and had almost thrown in the towel. Then a friend introduced me to the Marshall Emberton II Portable Bluetooth Speaker, claiming it's as good or better than his fancy B&O speaker, but less than half the price.Now, when I saw the Marshall speaker's price tag at $128.00, I hesitated. I mean, I've been forking out $250.00 and more for other speakers. But curiosity got the better of me, and boy, am I glad it did! The Marshall speaker not only shattered my expectations with its deep bass and distortion-free music, even at volumes that could make my ears bleed.

R1J6Z98WSUIRZ4,B09XXW54QG,4.0 out of 5 stars Great - with a few caveats,TJ,4,"This is an amazing speaker with excellent sound quality that surpassed expectations and competitors. The lower rating is due to the speaker's inability to go to a really low volume that I wanted for it to be a low key speaker for the bedroom. Also, Marshall allows pairing of speakers to play the same sound, or in stereo, but that apparently is only for when you have two of the same speakers. I have one of their larger speakers that I love, so I was very disappointed that their app doesn't allow pairing of two of their speakers that aren't identical. If you don't care about really low volume music or pairing with a different Marshall speaker, I can't recommend this more highly.","Reviewed in the United States December 4, 2023",AGQUN3KJYYOJNSILZUNTYO2M6FBA,True,2,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II,2023-12-04,Black & Brass,Emberton II,not listed

However a dude that tried & got dealt the friend card before I came along to my gf left this exact Marshall bt speaker in her car, & I understood why he was hounding her for it back. So even though he loathed me for landing the girl, I made it a point to return his speaker to him & ordered one of my very own immediately after. Yea, I coulda just kept his, but after hearing that thing I instantly knew & understood how much he valued that speaker. Also knowing it was worth the money I really didn’t mind just buying one for me. Hopefully this little story can convey how highly I rate this speaker.

Other than that this speaker does not meet my expectations sound wise. The speaker sounds okay on some songs, but overall it sounds very muffled. In order to get decent sound from it, you have to have it turned up to higher volumes. The lower volumes are way too muffled to be enjoyable.The product info says that it can charge other devices; however, from what I can tell it cannot charge other devices.In all honesty, I will probably return this speaker for something else that sounds better.","Reviewed in the United States July 20, 2022",AHI4H7NFM2SOQEBEPJCEMCGVNTLQ,True,21,Color: BlackStyle: SRS-XE200,2022-07-20,Black,SRS-XE200,not listed

I finally spent over $100, I went with name recognition in Sony & the 39.99 Ortizan X8 is louder. X8 much more depth of music & believe it or not, the X8 was capable of reproducing appropriate bass notes. The $100 Sony is flat sounding and not even a hint of low note reproduction. If the X8 could resolve connectivity issues, it'd be my choice, hands down. Sony gets 2 stars because of build quality & it has a nice strap.

It’s reasonably loud for its size, but not very loud compared to better quality speakers of the same size.

R26NYYKTFM4AAF,B0B44F1GGK,"5.0 out of 5 stars Powerful, great sound, good battery life, nice design",RedXepher82,5,"I really loved these bluetooth speakers as they are very durable, powerful clear sound, and look pretty nice. The first thing to note is that this is a wireless only device. It cannot be used with an aux cable so you need to use this via bluetooth. There is no real way to do a direct connected. That being said, if you are using a projector, you will need to be able to connect is via bluetooth. I have used it for my laptop via bluetooth it works great. The sound quality is really clear and has a pretty good base to it for the size. When it first arrived, the initial battery was around 50 percent. It lasted about four hours on just playing movie sounds alone from my laptop. Even with the bluetooth connection, it did not drain the battery too quickly. I charged it which took about three hours to get to full, but it all depends on what media you are using. When I charged it with my laptop, it took longer than it would with a wall plug or power hub. It does use a type c connector in order to charge the device. Afterwards, I tried pairing it via Bluetooth to my phone and the sound quality was amazing. There was no lag or static even from several feet away. The sound was crystal clear and had a good bass sound to it. The device itself isn't too heavy but it is a bit big so you are transporting it just know that. It will take a good amount of room in say your backpack. On Bluetooth from full charge I was able to use the speakers for several days on and off for 1 hour to 2 hours a day. The white color looks pretty nice and it is not as easy to see the scratches on the device. You do see it get visibly dirty and it is prone to sun damage. The material the device is made out of it is pretty sturdy but I wouldn't recommend dropping it. It is also not water resistant/proof so do not get it wet or you may damage the speakers. There is a really nice string hook that you can use to attach to your back pack or hang it. It is a really durable rope. Overall I think this is a great bluetooth speaker. It gives a good amount of range around 10-15 feet before losing any kind of sound quality and it last a pretty long time. It is definitely a must have if you like playing music on the go and it is a very durable speaker system. I do wish there was a way to connect it via wire but that is okay.","Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2023",AF6RFVIK2MSSR3PQTKQKAVK4HNRQ,False,0,Color: Light GrayStyle: SRS-XE200,2023-06-02,Light Gray,SRS-XE200,not listed

R3K1L360PPZ5YT,B0B44F1GGK,"4.0 out of 5 stars I have some issues, but for the most part I love it.",Rabbit,4,"For starters, I loathe Sony’s obsession with the proprietary, whether it be software, chargers, or special headphones that you have to have in order to properly use your own stuff. It drives me batty. This speaker, of course, wants to use Sony’s proprietary app for iPhone. It’s horrible. Skip it. It doesn’t do anything that Apple Music, Google Music, etc, can’t. In fact, I can do a lot more for my equalization with the iPhone’s inbuilt music app’s settings. It makes your phone’s battery drain faster, it doesn’t help with Bluetooth connectivity, it serves no purpose aside to inflate Sony’s proprietary status.Just utilize it like every other normal Bluetooth speaker. It has occasional hiccups and glitches in connection, which is weird, as I’ve had super generic speakers that never have any issues whatsoever, but this little guy drops out for no reason for a few seconds at a time every so often. It doesn’t make any sense. The app seems to make it worse somehow, maybe a latency in reading music files? I have no idea what’s happening there. It needs to be sorted, but that’s the only problem I’ve had.That may seem like a big drawback, but to me it isn’t. The occurrence of such dropouts are rare enough that I can ignore it. The sound quality is fantastic, as is the maximum playable volume. The sound can fill a rather large room with high ceilings with no problem. That’s fantastic, as I live in an old house with very tall rooms and wide open doorways. The battery life is decent, as I can usually get a good six hours or so out of a single charge at maximum volume. The blue colour is gorgeous and I love the slimline speaker look. It is pretty durable and has taken a couple of big knocks from falling off of my kitchen counter. The silicone covering is soft to the touch and easy to wipe clean and it charges with USB-C, so no proprietary bull there. It has an auxiliary jack, so I can use my old iPod Classic without using a Bluetooth transmitter.Unfortunately, or I guess fortunately, I haven’t tested it’s water resistance yet, as I don’t really feel great about tossing my nice new things in a filled bathtub for funsies. So if you really want to find out how water resistant one of these bad boys is, be my guest, it’s your money. But I prefer not to find these things out the hard way, if you get my drift.","Reviewed in the United States September 29, 2022",AGQDJA57TXC7G6FZQP2GQY5VBAIQ,False,2,Color: BlueStyle: SRS-XE200,2022-09-29,Blue,SRS-XE200,not listed
R1BSI08ET2JUBA,B0B44F1GGK,4.0 out of 5 stars A good rugged/waterproof speaker from Sony,Customer Review,4,"This Sony SRS-XE200 (Sony has the best product names, am I right?) is a tall cylindrical shape, but I don't think it has a 360 degree orientation like the old Amazon Echo speakers. This one fires out of the mesh on just one side, in one direction. If you have ever owned a pair of Sony earbuds or one of their sound bars, you will be familiar with their mobile apps. This one uses ""Music Center"" for changing any settings more advanced than changing the volume, this is also where you can update the firmware over bluetooth. This speaker supports Google Fast Pair, so if you have an Android smartphone, this makes pairing it super easy.The only negative thing about this speaker (from my perspective) is the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack for using a wired connection. This is purely bluetooth, so make sure you are good with that. It has a built-in microphone for phone calls or summoning a digital assistant (Google Assistant/Siri/Alexa). It does have USB C port for charging, but you cannot plug it up to something like a laptop use it over USB. It has a rapid charging feature, 10 minutes plugged in will equal 70 minutes of playtime. The 16 hour battery life rating seems to be accurate in my testing, that assumes you would be listening at 50% volume (this is always the case for quoted battery life estimates).If you're curious about the drivers inside, as far as I can tell, it is just one full-range driver measuring:42mm x 51mm. But, I'm not 100% sure because on Sony's website, it shows a cutaway diagram that appears to have dual drivers. The default configuration in the app is mono, but this could be because the drivers are arranged vertically (if there are two of them).This speaker is ideal for taking places, it's designed to be very durable and it is IP67 water-resistant (assuming you keep the protective flap closed over the USB C port). If you need one to keep at home on a shelf, there are better options than this for the price, with better sound quality.","Reviewed in the United States December 18, 2022",AH35XWTFCCK7DEATASGPXWVNSETQ,False,0,Color: Light GrayStyle: SRS-XE200,2022-12-18,Light Gray,SRS-XE200,not listed
R224LNL344ZL4S,B0B44F1GGK,5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound in a perfectly sized package,unrealtrip,5,"I use Bluetooth speakers every day, and because of that I have gone through many different ones narrowing things down to what for me is an optimal everyday speaker when it comes to size, functionality, sound quality, and toughness. Like many people these days I attend a lot of online meetings, so a good clear microphone and the ability to hear voice audio well is important. I also like to listen to music throughout the day while I work, so it needs to sound good in that regard as well. Toughness is certainly a factor for a portable speaker as the possibility of dropping it or having it get knocked down is very real. And finally, the physical size and form factor is critical as it needs to be easy to grab and move to another room to bring a meeting or music with me.This Sony speaker hits every item on my list and then some. It uses USB-C for charging, the port hidden behind a secure but easy to remove rubber panel. The buttons down the side are easy to hit, and the indicator lights are clear and make sense. The microphone is your fairly typical micro-sized hole, though it works well for voice calls. When it comes to using it as a speakerphone, I’m told by others that my voice sounds clear, and locally I find that the audio is loud and clear, and people’s voices sound natural. Music sounds very good and there is a companion mobile app which you can use to adjust the lows/mids/highs to some degree. In fact, the companion app has many other things you can adjust as well, and it isn’t simply a gimmick.I haven’t tested the toughness beyond one of my kids accidentally knocking it off a table, but it didn’t sound bad when it hit the floor, and the rubberized exterior seemed to do its job well at absorbing the impact. I like the tether it has, which is handy for grabbing it from to move it, and the shape of the speaker itself is also nice as it completely prevents it from rolling away. Sound is projected largely through the center, and it sounds good both standing up or on its side.Overall, I’ve found this to be a near perfect speaker for my needs. I’ve used it daily for almost a month now and I have no complaints whatsoever. The battery life is great, the sound for both music and audio calls is excellent, and the physical form factor works really well for a handy everyday speaker.","Reviewed in the United States September 22, 2022",AH55RDCKO4VFJSNTEGFNKMOHUBPQ,False,2,Color: Light GrayStyle: SRS-XE200,2022-09-22,Light Gray,SRS-XE200,not listed
R1G3SZE1QZVNVF,B0B44F1GGK,5.0 out of 5 stars My new favorite portable speaker,Ernest Stalnaker,5,"The only portable speaker I used for a few years was an Ultimate Ears Boom 2, which I loved. It had great sound and was small enough take anywhere. But the battery finally died and it could not be charged anymore. Since it was out of warranty, I needed to get a new speaker. So I decided to give this new Sony XE200 a try. I have a few pairs of high-end Sony headphones and have always been impressed by the audio quality of their products. I chose the XE200 rather than the XE300 since it was the smallest model they sell in this line. It's a bit larger than my UE Boom 2 was, but it's still small enough to carry everywhere. Plus it has an integrated strap that makes it simple to carry, secure to my backpack, or hang on a hook wherever I happen to be at the time. The audio quality is absolutely amazing with this speaker! It is definitely better than my UE Boom 2, and I was very happy with how that one sounded. The range is better, probably because it has a newer version of Bluetooth. The battery life is better as well. Overall this is the perfect speaker for me. I can listen to high-quality audio wherever I go. It is also a great conference room speaker, thanks to the excellent microphone that is built in. If you need a small speaker that is portable but sounds just as good as much larger speakers, I don't think you'll find anything better than the Sony XE200.","Reviewed in the United States September 20, 2022",AFKD6XBSKL6VCRHFPFIHZUCMIZFA,False,0,Color: BlackStyle: SRS-XE200,2022-09-20,Black,SRS-XE200,not listed
R2643Q0PAJQRTB,B0B44F1GGK,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great weather proofing, long battery life, okay sound.",What The Tech,4,"The media could not be loaded. What you should know: The Sony SRS-XE200 is a loud little speaker, but with no bass. Battery life is good, but you are really paying for the IP67 rating with this one.The Good: This speaker feels like a quality product. The outer rubber coating is soft to the touch and feels like it will last through the elements. The other materials used is a mesh webbing pattern that gives it some style and flare. The buttons on the side are simple and easy to understand. They feel good when you push them in. The included strap is awesome, Sony did not cheap out on the materials. It should hold up through many uses without fraying for a long time. The blue color way is very vibrant and just pops amongst so many other darker colored speakers. The setup is super easy, you don’t need to download the Sony app if you don’t want to. If you do download the app, you get some other sound features. The weight of this speaker seems to be light compared to some others in the category. You can just through this in your beach bag or backpack and not worry that it’s taking up too much room.The Bad: The sound quality is just okay. This does get loud to fill up a room in the house, but the bass is so tiny I wouldn’t recommend full volume. For playing music in a small setting and relaxing on the beach, this speaker should meet that customers needs.","Reviewed in the United States September 30, 2022",AEFAKJW6V2VR7QJAUR6HIAQALVYA,False,9,Color: BlueStyle: SRS-XE200,2022-09-30,Blue,SRS-XE200,not listed

The size is great, it is not super heavy, and it was easy for her to set up with her phone (which is a miracle).As for me, I think for the price at time of review and for it being Sony, I expected a bit more. The build quality is there for sure, but the sound quality is not so much. I have other similarly sized and priced speakers that sound significantly better than this. So, I docked a star for the sound quality.Everything else about the speaker is great and I would cautiously recommend it as a decent mobile speaker. However, if you are picky about sound, I recommend you choose another option.","Reviewed in the United States September 28, 2022",AGPRPQC4S6QFOGFC5KAJPFZDUDDQ,False,1,Color: BlueStyle: SRS-XE200,2022-09-28,Blue,SRS-XE200,not listed

R2Q75U03YDA1MT,B0B44F1GGK,4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty good,K. Taylor,4,"This is a standard workhorse speaker that offers the build and audio quality you'd expect from Sony. It's nothing particularly special, but as a Sony product it's dependable and will keep going for years without issues, I'm sure.I find that portable Bluetooth speakers can be a little hit and miss when it comes to audio quality, so I tend to steer clear of sub-$100 options. This one just about clears the bar of what I'd expect at this price point. Of course you're paying a little for the brand name, but the audio is good enough for use by the side of the pool. The bass is acceptable, and the mids are crisp enough to make this a good speaker for listening to audiobooks and podcasts.","Reviewed in the United States October 12, 2022",AFT6V6RFEFVC7L4NVPFZS3CQ3MJA,False,0,Color: Light GrayStyle: SRS-XE200,2022-10-12,Light Gray,SRS-XE200,not listed

Volume isn't blasting, but it's much like other Bluetooth speakers of similar price and size I own--JBL, Ultimate Ears.Google Fast Pair works well. With an Android phone this speaker was immediately recognized, its picture displayed and paired with my phone without me having to open the settings at all.Speaker build quality is top notch. IP67 waterproofing means you can use it outdoors in the rain without worry.Adjust the equalization if you don't like the sound. I found a flat equalization sounds best to my ears. There's enough bass that you probably don't want to boost it if you're interested in a full sound spectrum.Works well as a speaker phone. Has the ability for you to mute the microphone if you're using it for phone calls.Overall, this is very much the kind of quality and sound you expect from Sony.","Reviewed in the United States September 20, 2022",AFETC3OMUM4P4QGLIAHS4C7REIOQ,False,0,Color: BlueStyle: SRS-XE200,2022-09-20,Blue,SRS-XE200,not listed

Pulled it out of the box, charged it in a couple of hours, and establishing a connection with my phone and laptop was so easy. When I turn the speaker on now, it pairs automatically with my devices, and it verbalizes when it connects to a device. It can connect multiple devices at once, but I have only needed to connect two devices for my needs.The sound quality is excellent. At lower volumes, the bass is stronger than the rest. The middle to upper volume range has better overall balance. The speaker works best for music; even though it works for calls, there is a slight delay due to Bluetooth connectivity.The build feels durable. The plastic parts of made of a silicon-like material, which dust seems to stick to, unfortunately. It’s not difficult to wipe off though. The carrying strap is convenient, but overall, the size of the speaker is very portable and easy to hold.The 16-hour playing time will probably be affected by the number of devices connected and the volume you have it at. The battery life works well for me, and the USB-C charging is convenient because most other devices utilize USB-C.There are definitely cheaper speakers out there, but I would say this one is worth a shot.","Reviewed in the United States October 13, 2022",AGGWBBGDEUM7KFRRDEHIPROA3V7Q,False,0,Color: Light GrayStyle: SRS-XE200,2022-10-13,Light Gray,SRS-XE200,not listed
R2MR5H6IUUV3VW,B0B44F1GGK,5.0 out of 5 stars So PORTABLE AND GOOD SOUNDING!,Simon,5,"The design and features of this speaker already impressed me on paper, and the sound even impressed me more! First thing first, the features: being waterproof, dustproof and shock proof caught my attention as I was looking for a soeaker that I can take with me paddle boarding and kayaking! The ability to use it as a speaker for my phone while the phone is in a dry sack is also an essential feature for me getting this speaker. Then comes the sound! The design of the speaker able to be heard all the way around it so clearly is one of the best in this category. At first I wasn't sure if I should place it horizontally or vertically on the paddle board to get the best sound...but it actually didn't matter. Another feature that I like is the lanyard that's attached to it, its a heavy duty one! I was able to hang the speaker on my back pack while riding my mountain bike and it sounded like I have surround speakers on the trails ( not kidding!)...I got compliments from my fellow riders!Now, for the things I can say that should be better for this product? I can only say one thing-more low end!Overall, I can say that this speaker is one of the best in its category.

I would recommend this one over Bose any time.","Reviewed in the United States July 4, 2024",AFDOMPOAJFP2RND4EHFPYG2UFKIA,True,2,Color: Red,2024-07-04,Red,not listed,not listed

R3B50FJN1UU9BC,B08X4YMTPM,3.0 out of 5 stars Audio Engineers point of view,Christo,3,"I purchased two of these to work as a stereo pair in my apartment to obtain a nice full sound without having to really crank the volume to have an enjoyable experience and bother the neighbors.Well it all started out great, the white look clean and are small enough to not take up too much visual space. They also sound fantastic for a battery powered speaker, relatively full low end and crisp highs without needing to be EQed. They are setup roughly 15’ feet from one another in opposing corners of my studio space. They add presence and a fullness that I was missing from my Notabrick Bluetooth speakers.Now for THE PROBLEMS:I synced the speakers together and switched them to “stereo” mode from the app with no problem using my iPhone 13 Pro running Bluetooth 5.1. When it was time to connect it to my stationary media hub it was intended for (a 2020 iPad 8th gen) it would only connect one speaker and not allow for a party link or stereo link between the two Charge 5’s anymore. It took my some time of testing and no help from the internet to find out that the Bluetooth 4.2 that the iPad uses means the JBLs could no longer connect in a pair. I figured they had their own connection protocol (perhaps wifi 2.4ghz) for party mode. This shared audio functionality will ONLY work if your device that is sending audio is Bluetooth 5.1.SECOND ISSUE:So I put the iPad aside and would only be using my iPhone for music since that’s the only way I could get the Stereo mode to function. But after 15-30 minutes of music playback the speakers will disconnect themselves from one another requiring you to manually go to them and reconnect themselves. Every third time or so they will also drop the Bluetooth connection requiring you to “forget device” on your phone and resync Bluetooth to your host Charge 5 and then relink the speakers.This is all to say that if you want to use more than one speaker, even using a compatible Bluetooth 5.1 device that they are extremely finicky. Using a single Charge 5 has proved to be very reliable, sound great and look great. I am an audiophile and have many thousands of dollars in pro audio.The current tested Firmware version is 0.8.6.0 and has not been updated for over a year so this is unlikely to be fixed.UPDATE: I purchased two Charge 4 speakers to run through all the same testing and scenarios as the newer Charge 5 Models and found that with the exception of the occasional dropout and auto reconnection (perhaps once every two hours or so) these have solved all my issues. In fact, having the Aux plug on this model has also meant I can plugin my DJ decks to them when we are at the park and the primary speaker that is being plugged into will duplicate the signal and send it to the second speaker wirelessly with no issues. There is about one second of lag with this setup so the use of my DJ headphones is a requirement, but I love the added functionality. I also find the battery meters to be much more easy to read on the Charge 4. Finally, I do not know if it's because the transmission power of the Bluetooth 4.2 in the Charge 4 over the Bluetooth 5.1 in the Charge 5, but I find that I get a longer transmission range with no dropouts with the older Charge 4 model. On paper this should be backwards but testing 4 independent units in different scenarios have shown this to be recurring findings for me. I have used the 2020 iPad, iPhone 13 pro and Macbook M1 pro and a HD Firestick as my test subjects.I do notice that the Charge 5 has a slight edge in real world testing for maximum volume and clearly has a crisper high end to it where the Charge 4 sounds a little more round but is still very pleasing to the ear. I suggest to save a ton of money and pickup the Charge 4 if you are planning on using them in a multi speaker setup like me.","Reviewed in the United States December 15, 2023",AE5UFAYXB2EX2T4NQ5HFHWATP6NA,True,20,Color: White,2023-12-15,White,not listed,not listed

R1D9I181C4INKE,B08X4YMTPM,5.0 out of 5 stars Great little speakers,The pc builder,5,So let start off by I’m old school when it comes to selecting speaker. I have a massive surround system that sound great! I stumbled across the little speaker by accident. So I was doing a cell phone upgrade and they asked if I wanted a Bluetooth speaker versus 2 wireless stands… I opted for the Bluetooth speaker as I had 2 wireless stands that work great. So I hooked this little flip 6 up and was amazed by the sound of this little thing. So I was doing a bit of research and finding that I could hook other speakers. So I opted to pick up another flip 6 and put them into stereo mode. I was floored by the sound out of these little speakers and the stereo field was amazing too!!! So then I was wanting to see how the charge 5 would stack up and then combine them. The one charge 5 has an edge on the bass but the mids and highs of the flip 6 held there ground and sounded a bit better to me. Now I starting thinking of 2.1 sound and this is where everything just shined very bright. Have the best of both worlds highs mids and lows in 3 small speakers!!! Some of the music that I demonstrate in this set up was Rush - The Weapon.. this has some really nice percussion section with some stereo left to right separation. I also played Led Zeppelin’s- Stairway To Heaven for the same reasons or the stereo left to right separation and over rounded sound. Great news it passes with flying colors and I give these 5 stars all day long. I’d like to pick up the extreme 3 and give it a go in this set up as it has the AUX jack that would make it useful enough to hook up external AM/FM with USB and SD card. In closing don’t overlook these speaker I really enjoy my little speaker and I’m sure you’ll love too!!!!,"Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2024",AFPGGENH3QGVQQIBUDQY26SDVVKA,True,2,Color: Black,2024-02-19,Black,not listed,not listed

It made me jump when I first connected it to blue tooth with a song. And it was only up halfway. I took it outside for a real spin so I could see how loud it actually got, and OMFG. Made my old UE Megaboom look tragic, and I was obsesses with that. I drew a few neighbors out of their houses to see where the party at, and it was just me listening to some quality sound that I didn't even imagine. So glad I chose it over the BOSE speaker, and it was on a great sale.

I’m a die hard JBL guy I put sound systems in trucks with their products and they are awesome. This model was kind of a let down so I purchased a jbl flip 6 same day in person it’s pretty good and compares to the charge 5 so then I purchased soundcore boom 2 all received with in 24 hours tested all three and I think the boom 2 is better for sound but the charge 5 is better for taking places . I like music when I’m working so sound quality is important to me. I’d say skip the charge 5 get a more expensive model or save money get the flip 6 which is like the charge 5 or get good quality in this speaker bracket by getting the boom 2 for 100 bucks. Ps the jbl app to mess with EQ is lacking in customization and barely changes the sounds. Honest opinion I spent a lot of money in 24 hours and I choose the boom 2 this go around.

The tone when pairing emits a very low end bass note that gets you excited for the performance expected from Beats... However, with this being said, the performance is only half of what I hoped... the programmed sound processing limits using an external eq as boosted bass significantly drops the volume at each note, which is sad because pill doesn't have an eq in its app at all.... the sound you get between 40 percent and lower is where this shines, mids are clear and neutral, highs are clear and crisp without any harshness, and there is a slight amount of low end at lower volume, but past halfway volume and the bass distorts and the programming takes over to then roll off the bass and then it's mostly just mids and highs.... They seriously could've added a passive radiator to the back of this thing and then would have something here....

R3A0CT3JVYDFX3,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars Bass Heavy,Geomancer,4,"As you can probably tell from the product description heavily focusing on the subwoofer, you won't be surprised to learn that this speaker is very bass heavy. That's fine for songs that complement that kind of sound, but is a determent to anything else. For example listening to an audio book it doesn't sound very good and I actually prefer my phone's built in speaker or a regular set of headphones. There is no EQ feature, even if you download the Beats app. Speaking of the Beats app, it doesn't really have any use. It will tell you battery life, and remind you what the controls are, but that's it. The ""one touch connect"" feature did not work, I had to manually connect in my Bluetooth settings (Android, Samsung Galaxy S20 FE).For controls there are four buttons. A power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up. They are the same color as the speaker, do not light up, and are difficult to see. I initially had some trouble turning it off because you have to hold the power button. However if you don't hold it long enough it just gives you a battery life indicator, hold it too long it goes into pairing mode. You have a 2-3 second window between those two functions to actually get it to turn off.Volume wise, it does get pretty loud. Loud enough to hurt if you're nearby. Bass of course travels well and far, be aware that you will annoy your neighbors if your outside with the volume up. Perhaps even at a mid volume because it is so bass heavy. Not great for apartments because of that, at least if you don't want to be that annoying neighbor.If you have two of these, you can sync them together either to just make them even louder (why would anyone want that? It already hurts at max volume), or as a stereo pair.For the price, I would have preferred a speaker with a more balanced audio profile. For tracks that do emphasize bass though it does sound pretty good. Overall I would classify my annoyances other than the sound profile as minor.","Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2024",AHS6VNLQVHWZLOI3RZ6ZXUWPK4OA,False,12,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+,2024-06-28,Matte Black,Pill,Without AppleCare+

But, for a small portable form factor, this pill doesn't sound half bad. It is definitely not my favorite in the sound quality department, but the portability factor makes it a keeper. Right now, I'm testing it on my kitchen window sill and it provides me with adequate sound whilst I rustle up grub for the fam. Highs are clear, mids are punchy, bass is present but it won't knock your socks off. If you're looking for a balance between portability and sound quality, then this might be your ticket at 150$. BUT, if you want better sound quality, save up another 100 bux and you can find a larger (even much larger) speakers that will SA-MOKE this one, but, you WILL sacrifice portability. One issue I found with this speaker is that the rubberized texture on the back is a dust and animal hair magnet. (Two cats and two GSD's...you GSD owners out there know the struggle) It will not wipe clean with your hand, but a very damp paper towel works like a charm.","Reviewed in the United States July 10, 2024",AFIPEJWLO34BKCROKOXTQOTHWOIQ,False,1,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+,2024-07-10,Matte Black,Pill,Without AppleCare+
R1IDSWYH8GDHSG,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars Beats pill returned with an amazing and sleek speaker for IOS/ android,Alan,5,"This is a very small and compact speaker, but for its size, it packs a serious punch. It's comparable to the JBL Flip 6. Sure, that speaker has even better bass, but this more complete package for its price, with speakerphone and in my opinion, more sexy design.-The bass is great, and the overall mid and high range is excellent, but I wouldn’t say it’s the best among portable speakers. This is overall a very bass-heavy speaker. I only own the black one, but I’m interested in trying out other models when I get a gold one (because it’s sexy af).-This is definitely the best-looking and sleekest portable speaker. It’s minimal, smooth, and easy to carry around. Sure, for the price, you can argue that you can get a “better” speaker, but what this speaker offers is a well-rounded package: nice sound with great bass, goes well with home decor without sticking out, and minimal with a beautiful design. It's especially easy to access if you're an Apple user. Speakerphone has decent clarity and nice usages in times.-Even though it says 24 hours of battery life, take it with a grain of salt. The fact is, the higher the volume you play, the more battery it consumes because it uses more power in the drivers and woofers to push out bass and sounds. So, don’t complain too much if you see faster drainage than advertised, lol. I play around 60%-70% volume range and very bass heavy songs. so I get about 6 1/2 hours from what I observed. Yours might vary.-The biggest critique I have is that it’s the worst-sounding speaker if you go above 80% volume. The distortion and fuzzy sound are awful. The higher the volume, the less bass you’ll hear, and the highs and mids kick in instead. To be fair, most small speakers are like this anyways. The best volume range I found is 30%-70%, especially 60%, which produces the most balanced bass and highs.In conclusion, if you want a small yet sleek speaker with great sound, then this is for you.By the way, don’t even compare this to the JBL Charge 5. It literally has different usage, and the size difference is there, lmao. A bigger and more expensive speaker can push out more sound and bass, LMAO. So yeah, it’s kind of like comparing apples to pears, lmao. I only say this because so many people compare this to the Charge 5 or other bigger speakers.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",AFASPTXSH53KJIWIFP33WH2XDYXA,False,1,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+,2024-07-01,Matte Black,Pill,Without AppleCare+

They claim the battery life is 24 hrs, and it may well be as we've been evaluating it for about a week off and on every day and it's still going strong.I tested it via Bluetooth, mainly streaming via Apple Music, and or it's size it packs quite a punch! Decent mids and highs, and it has bass! Not tons of bass [expected for it's size, it's just physics), but it's decent, if not exceptional given the size of this, but that is expected of any Beats branded speaker product, and this one doesn't disappoint! Another neat feature is that it allows the pairing to two Pill units for stereo music. It's easy to control, there are four buttons: power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up.I really like It also has a built-in mic so you can use it as a speaker phone as well, and it works pretty good.In summary, for the price, compared to other ""party"" speakers around the same price class, the Pill punches far above it's weight class, feature sound clarity with decent bass, lots of volume, and simplicity in design as we've come to expect from Beats. While maybe not the cheapest ""party"" speaker out there, it is among one of the best, if not the best, in it's price class.","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2024",AGMUT4BKXZBD5PKSMOD2QHVHSKZA,False,1,Color: Statement RedStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+,2024-07-13,Statement Red,Pill,Without AppleCare+
R2W2XN52WGT97C,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars HUGE audio punch in a small package - just what you expect from Beats!,Brett,5,"Beats has long been popular for producing audio products - headphones, earbuds, speakers and so on - with great sound that are loud and pack a punch in the form of ""boosted"" bass notes. In that case, this new Pill wireless speaker is more of the same great recipe. In a fairly compact form factor you get a Bluetooth speaker (it can connect with any Bluetooth device though the documentation is focused rightfully on what most people will do - either Apple or Android phones) that gets VERY loud with VERY rich/boosted bass. The audio is also clear for things like spoken word, so that's a positive overall.Outside of that, the Pill is water resistant (not waterproof, so don't drop it in the pool or leave it out in a thunderstorm, but it's okay - probably - if it gets splashed a bit or drizzled on somewhat - meaning that it's great for outdoor parties given the volume) and has solid battery life. I do like that it can act as a portable battery bank, charging phones if you need to. It's not the primary function, but it's nice to see manufactures add value-added extra functionality that doesn't require any extra accessories or things to carry along. The Pill appears to be very well-built and should prove quite durable. As an added bonus, all the packaging is recyclable - kudos to Beats on that!So if you like your music loud and bass heavy, then this is the wireless speaker for you. If that's the case, give it a try today!","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2024",AGN7FGMJLQ4WZBWMAZMMJYJOFPSQ,False,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+,2024-06-30,Matte Black,Pill,Without AppleCare+

There's support for both Apple and Android too which is nice.Sound quality is superb as expected too. Sharp highs and nice thick, booming bass.

There is no dedicated power button, and in fact there are no instructions anyplace in the Apple/Beats ecosystem that tell you how to turn it off. (Push the Action button for more than 1, but less than 1.8 seconds.... how dumb is that?) With only 4 buttons, there are too many button sequence combos to remember. Seriously, a volume up/down AND a track up/down would have made life so much easier.All in all, this is a nice sounding Bluetooth speaker, with some good features, let down with a dumb user interface.

Not going to water test it, will save that for somebody else. Yes, I would recommend it.","Reviewed in the United States July 31, 2024",AE3KWAMUVSXDEQILGJTAR33SBJSA,True,0,Color: Black,2024-07-31,Black,not listed,not listed

R1NJVFBBSQHMJQ,B099TJGJ91,4.0 out of 5 stars Decent sound regardless of orientation,Amazon Customer,4,"It was on sale. It was purple. It was Bose. Those were my reasons for purchasing, despite the reviews complaining about the voice prompts. I used the Bose Connect app to set it up, but I deleted the app afterwards. It was always saying the speaker disconnected even though it was still playing. The app let me turn off the voice prompts. Then I found the actual user manual online and discovered an alternate method:Press and hold + and - simultaneously until you hear “Voice prompts off.”It sounds pretty good, but I mosty use it for voice.It doesn't matter how it is oriented; it still sounds good.But the material that it's made of is messy. It picks up dust and dog hair way too easily. I am trying to find a good way to keep it clean.I think it's going to work well for me.","Reviewed in the United States July 18, 2024",AHXBSFLODAFXN733X6TNRLBILMAA,True,1,Color: Chilled Lilac,2024-07-18,Chilled Lilac,not listed,not listed

The battery 🪫 life on this speaker SUCKS!!!! Bose needs to upgrade or do something about this speakers battery life.

RMUYYKJ5WTA8Q,B099TJGJ91,4.0 out of 5 stars The sound is awesome but...,HB,4,"It's a Bose so I expected high quality audio and the speaker does that. It's compact and that's part of the issue. It tips over very easily as the base is rather narrow. Second, the battery life leaves a bit to be desired. It's not as long as other speakers I have had but it's decent. I wish the bright white/blue lights were red or could be turned off. It gives off just enough light to be bothersome if you truly need a dark room to sleep. Forget using the app, all it does is connect and you don't really need it to even do that. It wouldn't control anything on this speaker. Lastly, why is it talking? I don't need it to tell me the battery level or that my device is disconnected. I don't need it to speak at all. It's rather annoying bc if you disconnect and don't turn it off, it promptly reminds you. Spooked the hell out of me several times. It gets 4 stars bc audio wise it's absolutely on point as expected. It's the little details that are missing that list a star. Would I buy again? With improvements yes, as is I'd have to think about it.","Reviewed in the United States May 26, 2024",AGRPNG4CNHIH5CUK2WGOP4EVFYJA,True,3,Color: Stone Blue,2024-05-26,Stone Blue,not listed,not listed

R36YHGL95K3QBJ,B099TJGJ91,3.0 out of 5 stars there’s a time and place for it!,Steven Jerome Staten II,3,"I purchased this because water broke my old Bose Revolve+. I don’t consider myself an audiophile, but I do listen to music religiously — 100k+ hours annually — and I can appreciate a crisp sounding speaker with nuance. This speaker lacks the nuance. It’s not terribly loud in my opinion, even on full volume in my small apartment. However, it is durable, and I love that it’s waterproof. Upon further research, I discovered that Bose is actually NOT worth the value for the money — many audiophiles recommend purchasing from another brand, as these speakers can be made for less than $50 and sold for $400+. Initially I purchased the Bose Soundlink MAX and another Flex (product listed here) as well, in hopes of amplifying the sound as well as achieving stereo sound in my apartment.After doing some research, I returned the Soundlink Max and one of the Flex speakers as well. I purchased some ELAC speakers instead for HOME use, and kept one of the Bose Flex speakers for shower use and traveling, as I spend a lot of time on the beach and this is dust and drop resistant. I purchased this on Prime Day for $99 before tax. I would NOT say it’s worth $150 full price. The battery is not great. I can leave it charging overnight and it dies with moderate use before the day is over. Mediocre in performance overall.It’s worth nothing that when I purchased the Soundlink Max from Amazon, the box itself clearly states that the speaker comes from Bose “RETURNS AND REPLACEMENTS.” I believe the speakers sold on sale are probably speakers that were defected or returned by other customers.

I'm a klutz and I expect I'll knock this over or to the ground at any point. Does not seem sturdy in that capacity. Otherwise it's a thick and dense little speaker.Functions as it's supposed to. Charged well when I got it. I can hear it from the other room when I walk away and it's got a nice clear quality to the speaker so far. The charging cord that came with it was quite short but functional. The speaker and instructions are insistent about downloading a useless connection application. Seems like another way to advertise more speakers or to sell user data. It was irritating enough, I almost rated this less because of it.Speaker will not connect to my phone via Bluetooth unless I allow the speaker access to contact information.

I have been looking for a replacement for some time but found most options lacking, especially in matching the Bose’s bass. However, from the first listen, these blew me away. They sound clean, can get very loud, amazing battery life but most of all they have unbelievably great bass from such a small package! It’s a bit bigger than the Bose but is actually lighter and overall build quality is excellent, with some nice details. The ULT mode is awesome and the connection is strong, even through walls or far away when outside. I love the orange but I am mindful that it is a cloth cover with semi-exposed tweeters on the ends, so I’d recommend a case or something if taking it to dirty environments or in a bag mixed with sharp things. The rubber on both sides does leave me comfortable that if this falls it won’t be any issue, plus it works well for placing vertically in tight spaces. Overall, can highly recommend and would say it’s no comparison to the UE boom, Bose sound link flex or Beats Pill I had previously tried.","Reviewed in the United States July 9, 2024",AETUKYROFNVEVSRJY2ABCK6XYUSA,True,4,Color: Orange,2024-07-09,Orange,not listed,not listed

R294Q4QN96UURC,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Magnificent Comeback by Sony with the ULT Field 1,Lu,5,"Wow, Sony! What a magnificent comeback. This is the best-sounding speaker I've encountered at this size and price. The hourglass shape is great for palming it. Initially, I didn't think I'd like the strap, but I love how tight it is—making it a perfect handle. The speaker can seamlessly stand or sit facing you or directly up to disperse the sound evenly. Doing a Hz test next to one of my Charge 5’s, it easily competes. I did these tests on my mattress to better feel the vibration of each unit. The Sony produced noticeably more vibration than the Charge 5, which blew my mind. Supposedly designed to compete with the Flip 6, it's, in my opinion, better than my Charge 5. Whatever Sony’s engineers are doing, they hit a home run. The clarity is wild, the bass response is wild, and the ULT button sounds like it’s unleashing the Iron Giant, and I’m here for that. Most speakers don't appear on my “connected devices” widget, but this one does. After listening for the last 4 hours at about 50% volume with ULT turned on, I only lost 20% of the battery. Bluetooth connection is swift, taking about 3 seconds from pressing the power button to streaming audio from your connected device. I purchased the orange ULT Field 1. Normally, I go for neutral colors like white, gray, or black, but this orange really pops and looks sweet. It comes with a short 12” Sony-branded USB-A to USB-C charging cable. Sony, you should hook us up with 3-foot cables. Sony has truly outdone themselves with the ULT Field 1. The combination of design, performance, and features makes it a standout speaker in its category.

R2LXPDPJ7ZTXGE,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect Poolside Speaker,E.J,5,"First off, I have 4 college age children so over the years we have gone through our share of portable speakers. So when Sony announced their new lineup and after reading a couple of early reviews I decided to take a chance on the new ULT1. As for the looks this ""Gator"" orange color is great. It stands out and it's exactly what I was looking for and when turning it on the first time it immediately notified my phone which made pairing simple. The design is perfect with the ""handle"" in the right spot and when I did my ""can it float test"" it righted itself every time and didn't loose a beat! As for that handle, at first it comes off a bit odd but once you realize it's dual purpose it's fairly cool. In terms of size it's about as good as it gets, as it's small enough to fit in a cup holder but big enough to feel substantial. Now for what counts. The sound quality is fantastic! As many other speakers in the same class I was expecting moderate performance but the sound was crisp, but not tin canish and the bass was great for a speaker this size. Out of the box it has the ULT boost on but you can shut it off with a touch of a button. From a durability standpoint the edges seem stout and could probably handle the inevitable drops to come! Finally as for the battery it lasted all afternoon on Mother's Day in the unforgiving Florida heat and humidity so I'd say it will do it's job on a beach day as well. All in all I'm very happy with the ULT1 and I'm looking forward to the enjoyment it will bring my family!","Reviewed in the United States May 13, 2024",AE4ZT3YRO52IIPX2LKOJLEM3STMQ,True,2,Color: Orange,2024-05-13,Orange,not listed,not listed

I was looking for days for a new speaker because my other one got jacked I had the Bose sound link mini which also is a great speaker but compared to the new model or this Sony xlt model I was torn. 1 I know how Bose is so I was like damn but I was looking into Sony and only because I was thinking of getting a tv and ppl who had Sony talked highly. There are so many Sony speakers and different price points. This speaker sounded like you had a subwoofer and connected speakers at a party that’s how the quality was in this mini speaker.

The app you download is not needed to play or connect it’s just nice if u have multiple speakers to connect gives you battery info etc. the charging is usb C and it fast charging. I just got this speaker and I’m writing a review this shows how excited and amazed I am still ha. The Price for the speaker well it’s definitely worth it. 1 u can buy two for under 300 vers 1 speaker for that price and have surround sound. The to speakers that come in this one price is worth it buy it if you are thinking about it. No jack cable I don’t have anything that needs it so I’m good haha. You can also play it sideways and it has some holes so it can work with out disrupting sound quality,"Reviewed in the United States June 23, 2024",AEEMRSATKMRUUULMPKY5YTLBZY5Q,True,4,Color: Orange,2024-06-23,Orange,not listed,not listed

R3SWOS1Q15L0AD,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound! Blows JBL and Bose away!,Johnny Utah,5,Went in to a local store and compared to JBL and Bose and Sony blew them away. Sony ULT 1 is awesome and I'll explain why.Bass is still extremely strong but does not drown out the highs and for the first time I hear a mid range. The sound is just so much better compared to JBL. JBL has always sounded hollow to me like I was missing half the sound. Now I realize it's just a small speaker but Sony made me realize I have been missing something. If you want great sound quality Sony does it best. The design is killer I currently have it on my island in the kitchen and it's super easy to connect with my iPhone. Most of all no light show pretty straight forward which I like when I go camping and the beach. I'm definitely going to get the bigger version ULT7 for the pool but wanted to test this one first.

I needed a speaker which could get a little wet. This little Sony speaker is just right. It's small, but has big sound. If it gets a little splashed, no problem. Perhaps I should point out that I can't wear hearing aids in the shower. So, this solved my problem. But, more than that, it's just a good sounding speaker and is well made.

But, unfortunately that’s where all the praise for me ends. Had this for about a week. The battery life, at medium volume lasted me on average about 6 and a half to 7 hours. Not quite what is advertised. Plus the sound really wasn’t that great, as others claimed. And it did not get loud enough for my preference. It’s an OK speaker, but not for the $128 price range. At best, maybe $79.99 would be more appropriate.

R1WVFAKBKYJEAQ,B0CXL4FQBK,4.0 out of 5 stars Decent affordable BT speaker - could be better.,REMY REVIEWS,4,"Just to summarize my thoughts on the ULT Field 1 quickly..Some pros:- Good quality audio- Dustproof, waterproof, etc.- SpeakerphoneSome cons:- Lacks good bass, despite it's ""ULT"" button. It's not terrible but it really seems to be hit and miss. I don't get why it varies but it's not what I expected.- Battery lifeFabric lined with silicone ends, it's fairly standard looking for a bluetooth speaker. A strap runs across the entire back which is useful for holding onto or hanging the speaker. Utilizes bluetooth, obviously, its is compatible with BT 5.3 and it supports Google Fast Pair. I didn't realize at first but you can link two units in the app for stereo playback.The control panel is a simple and intuitive layout. Power, Bluetooth pairing, play, volume up/down and ULT. The play button will also answer or end calls and it will navigate tracks.You get a cover on the back which protects the USB-C port. Charging with USB-C is great to see, by the way, and they include a USB-A to USB-C charging cable with the speaker.The speaker itself is IP67 rated which means completely dustproof and can be submerged at a depth of up to one meter for up to 30 minutes.I don't plan on using this as a speakerphone but it works well enough but you need to stay fairly close to the speaker as the signal doesn't seem particularly strong.Battery life just seems lackluster, just like the ""ULT"" bass. Sony says approximately 12 hours at volume 25 (50%) with the ULT function turned on. If you play at 100% volume, with ULT on, that drops to 3 hours. You can use the STAMINA function in the app for reduce power consumption. Speaking of battery life, and the app, when pair with your phone, you are able to see the speakers remaining battery life on your phone.Overall, it's fine. It's nothing special and even at the affordable price, I think there are better options out there from some of the big name competitors. I wasn't sure whether or not to give it 3 or 4 stars. I'd give it 3.5, if that were an option but it's not so I rounded up.","Reviewed in the United States May 8, 2024",AGPFBQD6BRRKEVEI3IAKXAEV4WWA,False,2,Color: Black,2024-05-08,Black,not listed,not listed
R3VJ6HBM3KLRK8,B0CXL4FQBK,4.0 out of 5 stars Sony ULT Field 1 Portable Bluetooth Speaker,MC,4,"First I'd like to say that this speaker has very nice appeal. It looks very nice sitting in an office, or even just on a shelf. The small design, is very well made. You can tell the difference right away when you first pick up this speaker, that it is not cheaply made (not that I would expect nothing less form Sony, or any other vendor of this caliber), and the design aspects are on point; to be beautiful and functional at the same time, with much attention to detail of the design.The thing that I wasn't impressed with is the sound. I think this speaker works well at low volumes. If you intend to listen to your music alone or in an office setting, then this may work for you, but don't engage in any high expectations from this speaker.As I mentioned earlier, if you set it on a low volume the sound is really not that bad. I would recommend turning on the ULT button, and never turning it off again for the life of the speaker. This gives it a much fuller sound at low volumes, and if you close your eyes and listen, then you just might hear a hint of bass coming through.If your mischievous, and you do decide to turn the volume up more than half way, then you wil begin to NOT enjoy the tinny sound coming from the speaker, as the clarity immediately fades away.","Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2024",AFEGGRZ2KH5OZPE5ESYHC2Y4USTA,False,3,Color: Off White,2024-06-01,Off White,not listed,not listed
R73UKTQOWQ00E,B0CXL4FQBK,"5.0 out of 5 stars Nice little speaker, great sound!",E.Swope,5,"I could say that this little speaker is surprisingly loud... but Sony is not all about loud, it is more about uality. That it has a solid build quality is more or less a given, reliability and connectivity too. The Sony Ult field 1 speaker hearkens back to their XB series. That is, it has the familiar form... and if you have seen it a lot, that is the speaker the others were imitating. Like all of Sony's portable speakers (that I am aware of) it is rated ip67 for water and dust resistance. It is pretty rugged, but don't throw it in a pool. It is not 100% waterproof. Sony doesn't play a lot of tricks to distract you from mediocre sound, because it isn't. Like few other companies which make portable blue tooth speakers, Sony does provide some audio spec... because ther3 is nothing to hide. Unlike most other portable blue tooth speakers, this small speaker has full range sound: 20 hz to 20 khz. They don't brag about their tuning. because they do not have to tweak it to cover the missing detail. All that said, the sound is rich and details. While you do not see a prominent bass boost, it is, essentially, built in (and the ult button does provide that boost, should you want it). The Field one is pretty pared down, no flashing or pulsating lights, just great sound. It may not be the loudest put there, but it is absolutely loud enough. I listened to it outdoors yesterday, and despite its' size it holds up well to open air listening. It is also very easy to use, with dedicated buttons for each function. The one surprise to me is that there are no high res blue tooth codecs, and no aux in, but then if you are using aux in it is somewhat less portable... This one is, very portable, easy to carry, easy to use, easy to listen to. I haven't found anything which does not sound good on this speaker, but that is what you get with a full range speaker. I buy a lot of Sony equipment because it is reliable in so many ways, build quality, sound quality, stable connections and up to date protocols. At the end of the day, yes this little speaker sounds louder than you would expect from its' size, but also richer, fuller and with great clarity and detail.","Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2024",AGASAFHLQKQP7RNG76TKN4GPBJBQ,False,0,Color: Orange,2024-05-20,Orange,not listed,not listed
R29M7D39J532PZ,B0CXL4FQBK,4.0 out of 5 stars Not necessarily an improvement from their past offerings,tkm,4,"I've always been a huge fan of Sony bluetooth speakers because they offered great quality, build and sound. While the Sony quality is still there, I'm not sure the sound is up-to-par with their past offerings.There's a lot of competitors in this space and what set Sony apart from them was that they really focused on making a great sounding speaker including a ""live sound"" mode, extra bass, all with having stereo drivers. Unfortunately, the stereo drivers have been abandoned so that means no more spatial live sound mode (which sounded great, BTW). The extra bass is still there, but that's there in most all of the models around this price range.Bose and JBL both mostly abandoned stereo drivers a while back but Sony still held out and I rewarded them with my purchases. Now, I don't really see much difference between a Sony, JBL and many of the other players on the market (Tribit, etc). Granted, a bluetooth speaker is typically not a critical listening device, but the Sony's of the past were borderline audiophile in their implementation. They, by far, had the best stereo implementation out of a single box bluetooth speaker. Whatever DSP magic they built into them was fantastic. That magic is, unfortunately, gone for this speaker line.The bass on the Sony is still really good though...I played a 50hz test-tone and was able to hear the tone clearly. Many so-called ""extra bass"" speakers can't even come close to playing a note that low, so the Sony still does a fantastic job in that area.The build is still good; typical of what you'd expect a Sony to be. This speaker does lack a 3.5mm input jack though (which I'm not sure why as it could have easily been put next to the USB-C port that's under a rubber cover). Bluetooth connectivity was easy. Fortunately, no ridiculous LED lights on this model so I am thankful for that. In the past Sony did give the option to turn them off or make them a solid color vs. always having them flash to the beat of the music like other brands forced upon you.I did not try TWS as I do not have two of the units. However, this would likely be the best way to listen to them as I'd love to hear a stereo image from a pair of these. My curiosity might get the best of me and if so I will update this review at that time.I'm not sure why Sony abandoned their last few generations of bluetooth speakers so quickly. Seems like just last year or so the best bluetooth speaker they've ever made IMO (the SRS-XBx3, specifically the XB43) was being cleared out for the new XG series. Now we're getting the ULT series after a short amount of time. I don't want to say that this new series sounds poor, as it certainly does not. But, it's just another mono speaker now and seems to be made for the poolside/beach party rather than listening more critically in a kitchen or bedroom. Granted, it does have a lot of low and quality bass so that mojo has not went away, but the live sound modes and dual L/R drivers disappearing is a disappointment.So as a long time Sony bluetooth speaker fan I am a bit disappointed in the direction that they've taken with the ULT lineup. They still make some of the best bluetooth speakers available, but their focus now seems to be headed in a different direction. If that direction is a pool party or other outdoor party-type of environment, this speaker will serve you very well and is certainly the quality and clear sound that you'd expect from the Sony name. If you have one of their older stereo speakers and enjoy it, hold onto that as this version will likely only be a suitable replacement if you buy two of them for TWS mode.","Reviewed in the United States May 7, 2024",AGOT7D3GZFVAZMP5VJUXVODL3U2A,False,12,Color: Black,2024-05-07,Black,not listed,not listed

R14TDMYNDRULVM,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Sony ULT Field 1 Bluetooth Speaker,M. Hill,5,"Featuring enhanced bass this Bluetooth speaker is compact and has noticeable weight for its size which gives it a quality feel. It arrives with a one foot long USB A to USB C charging cable and while it may be operated manually as a standard Bluetooth speaker it may also be controlled by the Sony Music Center app which to fully utilize all the features requires at least a second speaker. A small reference guide is included but a UPC code is provided on the underside of the box lid for an online version of a more detailed manual.For a Bluetooth speaker where portability is the point the sound is surprising good--clear and precise although at higher volumes reproduction is somewhat tinny. The bass boost adds depth which seems all the more necessary in an outdoor setting where acoustics are non-existent. Overall at this price point the speaker has an excellent sound and a solid build. If interested operation details follow.On arrival I plugged it into a USB A charging port during which a small orange LED light located below the power button was illuminated and when fully charged the light went out. After gently pressing the power button a small green light and a small blue light are illuminated. If familiar with Bluetooth pairing the operation is straightforward and if not information is available in the manual. Ready to listen to music I manually connected the speaker to my iPhone music library.The touch control panel at the top of the speaker includes a power, Bluetooth, play/pause, volume minus & plus along with the ULT bass boost control. A water resistant trap door at the back of speaker covers a USB C port for charging. There is a built-in omnidirectional microphone to use during phone calls. The location is not obvious but it is approximately an inch to the right of the control panel and an inch below.Battery life is stated to be 12 hours at level 25 volume which is approximately 50 percent and at full volume 3 hours. The ends on the speaker have a rubberized bumper which should offer some shock protection if dropped. The IP67 rating means it is dustproof and water resistant in up to 3 feet of water for a maximum of 30 minutes. It has a simple removable woven strap for transporting the device.","Reviewed in the United States May 15, 2024",AHCFDFVAK4QZPXXF35WGU3MVFVDA,False,1,Color: Black,2024-05-15,Black,not listed,not listed

Whatever consumer electronics you buy, whether a TV, stereo or whatever, if it has the Sony label on it, you expect it to be good. That is part of the brand.This speaker delivers the quality you'd expect from Sony. I have a number of bluetooth speakers and some are just ok. This Sony speaker has great sound and isn't too big or bulky.It has a nice rope-like handle for carrying.It connects easily via bluetooth and feels durable. The quality of the speaker seems excellent.It has a ton of extra features which I have not tested. Honestly, I don't often pair multiple speakers or use my speakers for phone calls, but it's nice to know this speaker has those features if you need them.For me, bluetooth speakers need to have good sound and be mobile, as I often take them on the go. This speaker delivers on both fronts. You can certainly pay less for a no-name speaker that gives ok sound and features. But this speaker is very reasonably priced and as I stated, with the Sony brand, you pretty much already know the quality is going to be good.

R3NFO7DBA3ZQJH,B0CXL4FQBK,"5.0 out of 5 stars For it's size, it sounds great. The bass does get deep.",J. Victor,5,"Only the Tribit Stormbox Flow has louder deep bass than the Sony Ult 1 in this size category. But the Flow also only has one driver, and it just doesn't sound as detailed even if you adjust the EQ using the Tribit app for more clarity. I would rather have the Sony Ult 1 as my go to small speaker for overall performance.That said, for $128 (at time of review) there are other speakers that I would direct your attention as better alternatives if you don't mind the size being bigger.The Lonzuer Action is the speaker on the left in the picture. It's not much heavier, and at time of this review it is $108.99 and gets louder with much fuller bass than the Sony Ult 1. It features a back firing speaker at the rear that when put close to a wall (but not against the wall) really helps fill up a room. It's retro look is sleek, it has bass, volume, and treble knobs on top for quick adjustment. It has louder bass than a JBL Xtreme 2.The MLove A200 is a gem. It's the off-white and gold speaker in the pic. This thing has MEGA bass. I was shocked at how good it sounds relative to it's price. It has volume, bass, and treble knobs. It gets loud but with controlled bass. It really is at the price of $90 (at time of review) a steal in terms of sound per dollar. It's my go to when I don't want to lug a bigger partybox or the Stormbox Blast around.Lastly, the DOLPHIN LX90 at $120 (at time of this review) is a real party speaker. It has tight punchy deep bass - and it should, it's a huge speaker. It's mids and highs are kind of a mess, it's not meant for critical listening. It's just big dumb fun. The A200 and the LX-90 are pretty neck and neck in terms of overall bass. But the LX90 gets loud, making it a great budget boombox.There you have it, this is a great speaker for it's size. It has a 3 band EQ in the Music Center app (instead of a 5 band for the ULT-7) But I laid out some alternatives in the price range that should be considered. They are all louder with more bass than this ULT1. I was very disappointed with the ULT7, if you are considering that monstrously overpriced thing go read my review on it.","Reviewed in the United States May 11, 2024",AFY73LAG6WW5YGYHTQ2IQ75BFLRA,False,5,Color: Orange,2024-05-11,Orange,not listed,not listed

It definitely pops and is a bit of a wow factor, so if you like more subtle colors for electronics etc. you may want to go with one of the other color options. I have several Sony speakers from the past years and this one is definitely up there with my favorites. My other favorite has lights that go to the music, this one does not include that but instead is a lot more portable which I love. Main reason for loving this speaker and Sony in general is the bass!A lot of other speakers around this price range, that are actually portable, just don’t sound good enough to me bc I don’t get enough bass. This one has a button labeled ULT which I believe means Ultimate. Well that button brings in bass or takes it away, and wow what a difference it makes turning it on! It isn’t bass that has too much vibration either, it really does completely compliment all sounds of the music playing. I also utterly love that it was sooo easy to pair to my phone! Literally turn on Bluetooth on both, and find the right speaker and pair!It does have an app you can use for all kinds of equalizer options which is great for customizing how you listen to music and being able to change things around depending on your taste! I am super content with the default settings but it’s nice to know that is an option for classical music or other unique sounds! I have not tested the waterproof level or ruggedness, and I love this speaker so much I don’t really want to get it dirty or wet! But it seems rugged, made out of great materials, and absolutely great to throw in a bag for a trip or mini adventure!

R2F8A2V513X8TL,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Powerful small portable speaker.,Ty,5,"Sony really hit a home run with their ULT line up. Already own the 7 series. Which is loud and powerful, while delivering a warm solid bass. I wanted something smaller that I can leave in the car.This unit is about 8"" inches long and a bit bigger than 3 "" inch in diameter. The speaker came fully charged and was wrapped nicely in a white cloth bag. The only accessory that comes with is a USB Type-C cable.Upon turning on the speaker, my phone immediately recognized the speaker with an icon of the speaker. Asked me if I wanted to pair the speaker and about 1 minute later. My phone with paired with the speaker.Having own other brands and off brands. I think Sony is really stepping up their game with the portable sound system. I played a few classical music like from Mozart and Beethoven. The mids and high are nice and crisp. The bass is tight and doesn't sound muddy. At 50% this speaker really rhunpa and sounds great. There was no hint of any distortion once I turned the volume up to 80%.Also tested this speaker with some 80' old school rap/hip hop. Man, does this little speaker really put out the bass and ""juice"". It got so loud, my wife has walked into the living room and asked me to turn it down.Overall this is a rich sounding and powerful bass speaker system. It definitely will live in the vehicle when we're out relaxing somewhere outdoor. The only gripe is not sure what to do with the Paracord type it's loop from end of the speaker to the next. So I might just remove it.Also it has a IP 67 rating so it will be perfect for the outdoors when I go camping. So anyone who's looking to get a small powerful rich sounding speaker. Check out Sony's ULT line up and give it a chance.

It turns out that it is; a really good portable speaker.One thing I liked was having a color choice. I'm getting weary of having all black devices, so being able to get an off white speaker (the same as my headphones) was a pleasure. You can also get gray or orange (orange? really?) instead of black or off white, but they didn't have the vibe I wanted. Nice to have the choice, though.Now, on to the speaker's sound. It's pretty remarkable. I wanted to give it a true test, so I first put it on the other side of the room, about twenty feet away, and let it do its thing using the ULT feature. I thought it might sound boomy, but it actually had a nicely balanced sound across a range of music genres. The sould filled the area nicely and, apart from its not having a stereo soundstage, sounded like a quality set of home speakers. I was surprised and very pleased. In shorter distances, I turned off the ULT feature and it still sounded great, without excess bass response at all.The speaker itself is a good size, too; not too large, like some of the behemoths you see these days. Still portable, and described as waterproof and dustproof, too. Very cool. Its charge time and duration are very reasonable, actually better than most bluetooth speakers I've had of about that size.So, you can see that I have nothing negative to say about this Sony product. I expect it to be my main bluetooth speaker henceforth, and plan to use it both indoors and out. Good product.","Reviewed in the United States May 6, 2024",AGR4VONEXHQ5LHWFAFYWB6ZQ4YQQ,False,1,Color: Off White,2024-05-06,Off White,not listed,not listed
R1KFPDDS60D3MW,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Decent option in a crowded field,Tyler,5,"The Sony ULT1 is pretty nice offering. It has the typical tall beer can size like the JBL Flip but is relatively light in a good way. I particularly like the parachute cord strap as nice feature. I compared the speaker to my two current favorites in size range, the Klipsch Nashville and the Bose Soundlink Flex, overall both speakers beat the Sony for sound quality. The Klipsch is something special sound wise but is quite a bit heavier in size, the Soundlink has a better out of the box sound, with EQ the Sony come very close. Ultimately the neither is a bad choice, the Sony is 20 dollars cheaper, but the Bose is frequently on sale. So while Sony isn’t the winner it still makes the podium and is good entry.","Reviewed in the United States June 19, 2024",AFQC76G7KO5TTAWJOIAREAKEJP5A,False,3,Color: Forest Gray,2024-06-19,Forest Gray,not listed,not listed

R34Q79KFSGV5F7,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars A high-quality speaker that'll blow all the cheaper competitors away,A. E.,5,"Pros:+ An actual premium Bluetooth speaker. After trying a lot of random off-brand Bluetooth speakers with mixed results, it's nice to use a name brand product that performs and ""just works.""+ The sound quality is fantastic. I don't know that it's quite ""audiophile"" level, but any range of music I've tried on this thing sounds great, which is usually my test of a new sound device.+ Very light, portable, and waterproof. So you can pretty much take it anywhere you want.+ Battery lasts long enough you probably only need to charge it in between sessions.+ Classic Sony style that looks good in black (wasn't brave enough to order orange!)Cons:- A little pricey, maybe.- If you want ""true"" stereo sound, you need to buy and pair a second speaker. That said, it's nice it has the option at all, and it sounds pretty good by itself.A great product if you want portable sound to take anywhere. This isn't going to be a cheap throwaway speaker, and I'm pretty sure it's among the best you can get for this type of product.","Reviewed in the United States May 23, 2024",AES5XH2PDCWFZOVX3WCALRGJTQDQ,False,0,Color: Black,2024-05-23,Black,not listed,not listed

Bought two of these so I can integrate with my other Sonos speakers, spreading sound around the house and on occasion outside. This speaker is great for such flexibility! I also put these two Roam 2 speakers in a stereo pair in a single room and am super impressed by the sound. Worth thinking about two of these as an alternative to more pricey Sonos options for your room. You will get pretty good sound plus flexibility/portability (at the expense of volume and depth of bass sound). Battery life is great, and I like the way the speakers sleep or power down when unplugged and idle for awhile, but stay up and awake if plugged in. The updated Sonos app keeps track of these even when powered off and picks them right up when powered on. Sonos is a great system and these Roam 2 speakers are a great addition for a portable option.","Reviewed in the United States July 27, 2024",AEKPQRCBV3DNLRZCMJSGQMSGSLAA,True,2,Color: Black,2024-07-27,Black,not listed,not listed

RZ3JZ2VUDV1OA,B0CY6S748H,4.0 out of 5 stars Underwhelming performance,M. Alvarez,4,"So, the positives right up front. Very small and portable. Simplistic but stylish. Easy to use and setup. Love the dedicated Bluetooth. Comes well packaged from Sonos. Very small and for its size, puts out good volume.Now the potential cons. I have a Sonos Arc and the Sonos Move (1st Gen). Got them both for a great sale price and the sound quality never ceases to impress me. Especially the Move, which even at very high volumes plays great music from rock, country and rap. I bought the roam to be more portable than my Move, which I use on the deck, poolside or at small gatherings. The Roam was more for hiking, beach trips and casual listening washing the car, etc. I have to say I am not impressed. It sounds decent at its highest volume although you can tell you’ve reached its limit. I never feel like any of my other Sonos products have hit a limit even at 100% volume. It also sounds almost flat and very mono sounding vs steep or simulated stereo. Worse, it’s okay with rock or country or anything that has very little bass, but don’t try and play any kind of rap or hip hip. The bass is almost non-existent and really makes it feel like you’re pushing the speakers beyond their capabilities.Granted, most small portable like this would have similar issues, but when I listen to my sons JBL Flip 5, which costs less than half the price, I feel like the bass is much richer and the sound is louder, but of relatively similar quality as the Sonos, which is very disappointing. Maybe I’m missing the mark on its intended use, but I don’t think so. For small sound and high portability, it’s okay, but feels overpriced when compared to a couple others for what it offers.Would have considered a slightly larger roam in its 2nd generation for larger speakers or drivers or a dedicated bass port. I’ll have to sample it for a while and along others. I’m on the fence keeping it vs returning it. I’ll update my decision later.UPDATE: okay, after using it down at the beach, I would have to say my opinion has changed some. While I still would like a bit more volume, it’s pretty good for small spaces and close to me or around the pool or campfire. Sound has grown on me for most music and I recognize what it is for its ultra portability. Battery life is good and it’s been easy to pair. Loud enough to enjoy, but not so loud as to annoy others around me at the beach. I bought it at full price for $179. If you wait for Prime Day or other major sales days, it drops to $143, which is a much more reasonable price where it’s worth it.","Reviewed in the United States July 8, 2024",AEFLVYVERRDW3B3YBXQF7SKRBXHA,True,9,Color: White,2024-07-08,White,not listed,not listed

I can see other speakers being better for the same price point, but here's a breakdown of what I have found after using it consistently for the past week or so:Connectivity - In the sense of range to connect, it is quite low. I have had multiple instances where I was using the speaker with bluetooth and it would start cutting out when I was 10+ feet away. On the other hand, you can also connect to this speaker through wifi which gives it great connectivity range.Ease of use - It is a pretty simple device with only 6 buttons (Play/Pause, volume up, volume down, voice activation, bluetooth, and power). No complaints here though I cannot speak for the voice feature as I have not used it yet.Sound quality - The sound quality is great for its size. If you are an audiophile, you have probably heard better speakers but for this size it is definitely above the standard.Battery Life - The battery life it pretty spotty and has been hard for me to understand. Sonos says it has 10 hour battery life off of full charge but I would probably say it is closer to 8.5-9 hrs from my use of it.Additional notes - The app is pretty annoying to use and can only be used when your device is connected to wifi. On the app you can control your music/audio you are playing and also balance the speakers treble and bass (something I have not been able to do off of wifi)","Reviewed in the United States July 30, 2024",AE775KVYVVC2ISN27P7OZDSY2SBQ,True,0,Color: Black,2024-07-30,Black,not listed,not listed

RUL2NHT5AJZTD,B01IOD7KB6,2.0 out of 5 stars Disappointed in almost every way - Don't buy!,Danny,2,"Attracted the successful marketing/branding pitch (""House of Marley"") and by the numerous positive reviews, I decided to purchase this speaker, despite its relatively high price in a product category with a huge number of high quality competitors. This was a mistake, and I am quite disappointed. Except for its look and styling, which I like very much (except for the exceptionally large and bulky size and weight, which I don't), there is nothing else that I like about this speaker:Sound quality - very tinny, almost unpleasant. I often listen to podcasts, and the default sound quality borders on unlistenable. I have to manipulate the equalizer settings on my phone app to be able to listen, and I have to do this every time. Very annoying. The situation is only slightly better when listening to music. Even my little first-generation Oontz Angle sounds better! In fact, my experience is at such odds with the reviews, that I wonder if I have a defective product.Size: I knew when I ordered that this was a larger system than most others in its quality and price range, but I guess I should have looked more closely at the dimensions, which are, for a ""portable"" system, huge and heavy. Maybe some people like this - not me. Much too big, much too heavy.Battery life - haven't measured it, but it is MUCH shorter than any other portable bluetooth speaker I have owned, and this was true right out of the box.Connection and operation: it works okay, but is annoyingly non-intuitive.Conclusion: poor sound quality, too big, short battery life, non-intuitive operation. There dozens of alternatives that will give you much better quality and satisfaction, for a lot less money. Stay away from the House of Marley, at least this particular product.","Reviewed in the United States April 30, 2018",AEJUHFEP7FRKBCAMWYULJID43ITA,True,3,Color: Signature Black,2018-04-30,Signature Black,not listed,not listed

R1RRZB90F1VYQI,B01IOD7KB6,3.0 out of 5 stars Sound quality is poor.,Patrick Porter,3,"I’ve had this speaker for almost a year, in which time I’ve used it indoors and out too many times to count. I’ve also read pretty much every review on here, so I’ll touch on some of the more frequent concerns.Sound quality: 1/5 very flat sounding with almost no bass and lackluster mids. Generally makes your music sound dull and lifeless. It does get fairly loud if you need it to, though. Acoustic music sounds alright, but that’s about it...Connections: 5/5 I’ve had no issues with the Bluetooth or aux port on this. Never drops or cuts out from my apple or android devices. Sounds like QC is a bit problematic though, as lots of people have had issues in this department.Portability: 2/5 No covers for the speakers always makes me nervous when taking this anywhere. Just waiting for the day I get a pen through it or something. Battery adds a point though, because it has been reliable and lasts as long as advertised.Build: 4/5 Everything looks like it was put together well. Materials are nice. Good weight to it.Other: I am constantly annoyed that this doesn’t have a remote. I just want to turn it on and pair without getting up...","Reviewed in the United States January 13, 2018",AFYB3LGAEKCS6ASTYBQFRKOTMAGQ,True,5,Color: Signature Black,2018-01-13,Signature Black,not listed,not listed

A remote or an over ride on this feature would be helpful. Five minutes of silence is all...don't get too comfortable, or take too much time to decide on what you want to listen to...five minutes....quick before it turns off...really annoying.

It will no loner charge, or even work while plugged in. It is a total brick. Extremely p*ssed off! Stay away!!So, I learned about this speaker cause a friend and I were at a new bar that had just opened and they didn't have their permanent speakers wired up yet. We saw this cool speaker, and both looked at each other and basically said, ""no way all this sound is coming from only this speaker!?"" And it was. I ordered one the next day. It's great, connects to BT on iPhone right away, range is on par with most better BT products, 30' +/-. Audio is very good for what it is, definitely above average. I also have a little Yamaha BT speaker (don't recall what model) and the Marley blows it away. I have heard some from JBL that sound good, the Marley is better. And above all else, the Marley is gorgeous Very well constructed, nice organic materials (no plastic here), nice to touch and look at.

I see this being the perfect speaker for poolside parties or maybe even the beach. This is the way Ultimate Ears has differentiated this speaker from a crowded field. It should last 20 hours and you can put multiple BOOM speakers into party mode. The range of 147 feet is kind of crazy!i walked 50 feet away and it worked perfectly fine. I don’t think I’d have a need to walk away 147 feet.I found the sound quality to be good to very good at lower to halfway volume levels. As I increase the volume past the halfway point, it doesn’t sound as clean. As advertised, the bass is booming. Use the equalizer in the app to set your preferred bass level. Compared to a Bose bluetooth speakers I own, I prefer the sound of the Bose. But the Ultimate Ears is very good and the sound isn’t far behind.The 2 features I wish it had is a microphone, in case I wanted to use as a speakerphone and a charging port. With a 20 hour battery, it should have enough just to charge your phone.The Ultimate Ears Megaboom 4 is a solid competitor if you’re looking for a portable speaker that is tough enough to handle your outdoor adventures!","Reviewed in the United States August 5, 2024",AGCC7MCZCKSDQMXOWOUEE224NKNA,False,0,Color: Black,2024-08-05,Black,not listed,not listed

It's great for your home, throwing in your bag, going to the pool, or for outdoor activities. It is also awesome for the bathroom to listen to music while you shower since it is waterproof. I love the features of it being dust proof, waterproof, and drop proof! I like how you can be rough with it and it still works great! I don't intend to be rough with it, but I love that it's ready for any scenario. It also gives you the confidence that you really can bring it anywhere with you! Also I LOVE that it can float, so if you drop it in water it's not a goner. I had been kayaking a little while back and my boat tipped over along with everything that wasn't tied to the kayak. I had a different UE Boom that I got that wasn't waterproof nor able to float because I didn't want to pay the extra for it. I mean who loses their portable speaker in a lake?! Let's talk about the sound, it sounds amazing! The 360* sound feature is fantastic and it truly works! I played some music in my living room and you could hear it from every angle loud and clear! I could even clearly hear the music in the kitchen while doing dishes with the water running! The sound is crisp and makes music sound like you're at a concert! It's not overly bass-y, but it does have some good bass and I think it really adds to the listening experience. Did I say that the sound is amazing, and is so fun to use?! Out of all my portable and even non portable speakers this one is by far the best and the best sounding! The speaker can be turned up to a very loud volume where everyone in the house can hear it, which makes it perfect for the outdoors too! The volume range is great, if you want to crank it you can, or if you need to keep it at a more respectful level then that's an option too. It has a great battery life, it lasts almost all day on a single charge. I never seem to play music all day but it can last awhile on one charge. It comes with a USBC charger, and I like how you don't have to plug this one in on the bottom of the speaker. If you have other Ultimate Ears speakers you can pair them together to get a really cool effect. It was very easy to pair my phone to the speaker and I didn't have any issues playing my music or staying connected. This speaker worked perfectly. There are other very neat features on this version that I haven't even gone over like the Magic button, which lets you access other playlists. It is an awesome quality speaker and performs amazingly! I love that it's rugged and you can bring it literally anywhere! This is a phenomenal portable speaker and I highly recommend it!","Reviewed in the United States August 1, 2024",AGR4TFBURFNDIPLCMOW6GFEFPBSA,False,2,Color: Black,2024-08-01,Black,not listed,not listed
R3EZZ7KTPGO1V7,B0CVFM97GD,5.0 out of 5 stars Megaboom 4,bdDD,5,"I got the Black variant. This is a great-sounding Bluetooth portable speaker. It has a cylindrical form factor and is designed to stand vertically. It weighs a hair over 2 lbs but feels very portable. In addition to being rated IP67 waterproof, purportedly, it also floats for worry-free use near water.I see “thunderous” used repeatedly on the product information page to describe the sound output but I think that creates unattainable expectations from a speaker this size. Nonetheless, the sound is big and --more evidently-- clear across the frequencies at all volume levels but tends to distort a little once you get close to 90% volume. EQ (5-band) can be customized via the UE Boom app, which is a great thing if you don't feel that any of the 5 presets from UE meet your needs. It doesn’t have a heavy bass thump (from its two passive radiators) but instead offers a more balanced and pleasant listening experience. Don’t get me wrong: there is bass for all the bass-heavy genres like hip-hop, EDM, but you won’t feel like you just left the club, and unlike many other speakers, that bass doesn’t come at the cost of mids and highs. Overall, it sounds more grown-up. I really like the 360-degree sound which UE claims is stereophonic, and I can only imagine how good sounding two of these would sound using the pairing feature.It charges via USB-C but the charging light is tucked down low and behind the flap that covers the charging port. It would have made more sense to place it up on top or where it would be easily viewable. On the upside, the battery life is purportedly 20 hrs. It has a tab (UE calls it a “bungee”) near the top of the speaker that looks like it could hold a carabiner or strap but neither are included, only a charging cable. This projects a broader and clearer soundstage than my JBL Flip 6 and my Soundcore XMotion 300, but this sits in a higher price bracket. There is a “magic button” which is essentially a multipurpose single button to control pause/play, skip track, and purportedly can be used for one-touch control to access playlists from Spotify, AmazonMusic and Apple Music, according to one of the bullets on the product information page. When I tried to set this up on the UE Boom app, it only provided AmazonMusic and Apple Music as options (no Spotify!), with a note to check back later as they continue to add more music services.One neat but trivial feature via the UE Boom app is that you can talk into your phone and have it projected on the speaker, like a PA speaker. It also claims that it’s made with a minimum of 54% recycled plastic by weight.This is now my go-to Bluetooth speaker around the house.","Reviewed in the United States July 28, 2024",AEA5LWYQIAMIJ25RVQBMCD6NQ2OQ,False,0,Color: Black,2024-07-28,Black,not listed,not listed
R3MFRLWN5UCX31,B0CVFM97GD,1.0 out of 5 stars Really overpriced for the sound you get.,J. Victor,1,"I had typed out a very long review and accidentally closed the window trying to change tabs. This is going to be shorter than that.I have the Wonderboom 4, Boom 4, Megaboom 4, and the Everboom. Out of all of them I think the smallest Wonderboom 4 sounds the best. They all get about the same loudness levels at max which is wild because they cost so much differently. The Megaboom 4 has the best sounding warmth, but it doesn't sound ""Good"". I have much cheaper speakers that sound better and get louder.I used a frequency generator to test the bass cutoff. Like the Everboom, it's 70hz. There is no sub bass response at all (under 60hz.) It sounds quite small despite it's price/size. It doesn't get very loud. It sounds muffled compared to other speakers, and has a hollow wooden character to vocals and guitars.I tested it against my two Earfun U Booms ($50 each) in TWS (True Wireless Stereo). Hands down night and day WAY better sound. Their bass response can reach down to 65hz. On paper that doesn't seem like much but it sure is noticeable. The U Booms at 50% volume were the same loudness as the Megaboom 4 at 75%. Volume is seriously lacking on the UE's (except the Wonderboom 4, it has good volume for it's price / size) The U Booms get MUCH louder than the Megaboom 4 at max.The Sony Ult1 is $130, it sounds far more natural with much deeper bass and more volume than the Megaboom4.The LFS Soundstorm is $130 with Boombox characteristics. With bass reaching down to 50hz, it sounds far bigger and get's super loud.The Mlove A200 is in the $95 price range, sounds much bigger and better. I could go on and on.I think you could buy a JBL Flip or Charge and it will also sound way better. I don't understand the UE fanboys. These speakers are a waste of money. (An argument can be made that the Wonderboom 4 is acceptable for it's price, but there are better sounding for the money like the Earfun U Boom)","Reviewed in the United States July 31, 2024",AFY73LAG6WW5YGYHTQ2IQ75BFLRA,False,0,Color: Black,2024-07-31,Black,not listed,not listed
R1MEFSZC4I66AJ,B0CVFM97GD,2.0 out of 5 stars “Thundering Bass” is certainly correct,Hapster,2,"The media could not be loaded. If by thundering they mean extremely loud and distorted. Bass driver constantly thuds against the unit’s interior at any reasonable volume making it all but useless for listening to music with any bass. How did this trash make it past any kind of critical review?2 stars for slick design, ease of use, cool, albeit gimmicky magic button, and being a $200 paperweight that spits out garbled sounds on command.","Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2024",AGINVDSYQS63XTLSEWWHHAVZGQMQ,False,12,Color: Black,2024-07-21,Black,not listed,not listed

This speaker is not only more portable, but is also heads over heels, in sound, BY FAR... at less than half the price.It is also decently durable. I haven't tested the water-proofness, because I generally don't put speakers in water, on purpose. I can say, though, that it really does seem that it can stand up to dropping IN WATER.. I emphasize the water part, because I have dropped it, and am grateful for the rubberized parts. Also, better than my Bose, is the fact that the charging port seems very waterproof.I haven't downloaded the app, yet, but I like it, without it.","Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2024",AGNPJO52UMINO4QBIZMV5XDSHPBA,False,1,Color: Black,2024-08-03,Black,not listed,not listed

R1JDJFQO569AU9,B0CVFM97GD,3.0 out of 5 stars Extremely overpriced speaker of just decent sound,bobwatts,3,"The media could not be loaded. I have always ascribed to the philosophy that if I’m going to listen to something, I require it to reproduce the One True Sound. In other words, as close to the original sound as possible. And I listen to music literally all day, sometimes all night also.Bluetooth speakers by definition are a compromise and will never be a substitute for a Real Sound System, but some manufacturers products perform a lot better than others. And it is an undeniable fact that Bluetooth and wireless speakers are getting far better.In the last four years alone, I have handled, listened to, tested and experienced hundreds of Bluetooth speakers and have written quite a few reviews. I bought a lot of them. Paid money. Some over $500.I don't claim ""audiophile"" status, but I am extremely discerning in my listening requirements.I will rarely mention competitors' products but might ""hint"" at something.I have been aware of Ultimate Ears products but have never purchased any, usually because I thought they were priced very high. Although they get good reviews (usually, certainly not always) I just didn't think that such a small speaker could deliver on the promise of ""Thundering Bass"". Well, they don't.I tried this speaker in every bass trap in my house that usually helps most speakers, and it did improve this speaker marginally. Using the speaker outside was pointless if volume and quality of sound is required.In the case of this speaker, it has 2"" drivers, one of each side of the cylindrical case. I am aware that this speaker has two passive radiators, and they are supposed to be ""softer"" than the Megaboom3 which ostensibly is supposed to improve bass response. I wouldn't expect much bass response from such small drivers, but the manufacturer clearly states ""Thundering Bass"" in the advertisement, and it is also on the box. (see picture).Not only have I heard smaller speakers with better bass, but I have heard and own many speakers costing far less than this one that outperforms this speaker by quite a large margin.I will say that for such a small speaker the bass response is remarkable, even good. But ""Thundering""?Ridiculous.And when cylindrical speakers claim to have ""360°"" sound, this is usually a falsehood as well. You can definitely hear a difference when one of the two drivers is pointed at you. Assuming that you should keep the volume controls pointed at you means that the very directional high frequency sounds are going off to the sides, away from you. By simply turning the speaker 90° you will hear the difference.I was struck by the look and size of this speaker when I received it so much that I decided to get my 2015 9-year-old first generation Amazon Echo speaker out of storage and compare the units. (this turned out to be a one-hour debacle to get it going again, long story) The two speakers are almost the exact same size.The Megaboom4 definitely had more bass (not by much), but the Echo was a bit brighter and clearer in the sound delivery. (see video) I downloaded the Ultimate Ears ap immediately upon arrival of the speaker and ""tuned"" it to my liking (which is usually maximum treble and bass, drop the mids slightly for most speakers) so I gave it the best chance of sounding good/great. I also tried the ""signature"" settings.This speaker connects quickly and stays connected. Controls work well. Speaker has a very nice professional appearance, and the box protects it well during shipment. The box also has a high degree of professionalism in its appearance.I appreciate the lack of silly lights, and the connection ""sounds"" are not as obnoxious or silly as most speakers, but the turning off sound is very loud.Frankly I would have given this speaker four stars if the manufacturer had not claimed ""Thundering Bass"". That is an outrageously false claim. This speaker sounds very good for what it is, but for the price, I can buy many better speakers. I actually have.If I had purchased this speaker I would have returned it.","Reviewed in the United States July 31, 2024",AHF7CXAQGU7WM5KXGQNMTYUOGWLQ,False,0,Color: Black,2024-07-31,Black,not listed,not listed
